\chapter{Hydrogen Bond Dynamics in Solution Systems}\label{CHAPTER_HB_SOLUTIONS}
%The influence of ions propensity for the aqueous surface on the water's HB network are also of special interest to the atmospheric chemistry community.
In this chapter, we explore the effects of nitrate ions, iodide ions and alkali metal cations 
on the HB dynamics and water reorientation dynamics at the water/vapor interface of alkali nitrate solutions and alkali
iodine solutions, by DFTMD simulations. %We will also provide microscopic interpretations of recent experimental results. \cite{HuaWei2014}
In paragraph \ref{HBD_ITP}, we discuss the influence of ions on the HB dynamics in the whole interface system; 
in paragraph \ref{SHB_dynamics}, we study the HB dynamics and HB lifetime in the solvation shells of the ions;
and in paragraph \ref{RAD}, we focus on the reorientation dynamics of water molecules in the solvation shells in the interfacial system; 
Finally, we study the orientation characteristics of water molecules in the ions' solvation shell in the interfacial system.

\section{HBD for the whole water/vapor interface}\label{HBD_ITP}
\paragraph{Lithium Nitrate Solutions} \label{PARAGRAPH_LINO3}
The simulated interfacial system consisted of 127 water molecules and a Li$^+$--nitrate pair in a periodic
box of size $15.78 \times 15.78 \times 31.56$ \AA$^3$, which corresponds to
a density of 0.997 g/cm$^3$. All simulations were performed at 300 K within
the canonical NVT ensemble. The discretized integration time step $\Delta t$ was
set to 0.5 fs. At each MD step the corrector was applied
only once, which implies just one preconditioned gradient calculation. 
The Brillouin zone was sampled at the $\Gamma$-point only and, the BLYP XC functional has been employed.
For a given molecular configuration, $\{\mathbf{r}_i (t)\}$, Eq.\thinspace\ref{eq:rho_c} can be
solved through interpolation on a spatial grid.\cite{Willard2010} 
Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:lino3_interface_all_add_z_trimed}
illustrates the obtained instantaneous interfaces for one configuration of a slab of 
LiNO$_3$ solution at 300 K. We have taken $\{\mathbf{r}_i (t)\}$ to refer to the positions of all
atoms except hydrogen atoms in the system, and because the bulk correlation length of
liquid water is about one molecular diameter, we have used $\xi$ 
=2.4 \AA; further, we have used $\rho_0= 0.016$ \AA $^{-3}$, which is
approximately one-half the bulk density of water.

for the slab of LiNO$_3$ solution, as computed from the ADH (solid line) and AHD (dashed line) criterion of H-bonds. 
The definition of the correlation function is based on the specific O-H pairs between molecules.} 
\end{figure}
The results of the correlation functions $C_\text{HB}(t)$ and $S_\text{HB}(t)$ for both nitrate--water (N--W) and water--water (W--W) H-bonds 
are shown in Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:c_and_s_ln_bk_pbc}a and \ref{fig:c_and_s_ln_bk_pbc}b, respectively.
For both HB definitions, it is found that the decay of the $C_\text{HB}(t)$ and $S_\text{HB}(t)$ for nitrate--water H-bonds is much faster 
than that for water--water H-bonds. From the relation \ref{eq:calculate_hb_lifetime_from_s}, the faster relaxation of $S_\text{HB}(t)$ implies that 
the nitrate--water H-bonds have shorter lifetime than the water--water H-bonds in the bulk phase. 
This result is obtained from a DFTMD simulation of a bulk phase of LiNO$_3$ solution at 300 K. 
The simulated system consisted of 127 water molecules and a Li$^+$--NO$_3^-$ ion pair
in a periodic cubic box of length $L=15.79$ \AA, which corresponds to a density of 0.997 g cm$^{-3}$. 
The calculation results obtained from the simulations are in good agreement with numerous experimental results and simulation results. \cite{Tongraar2006} 
It means that nitrate has structure-breaking ability, or compared with W--W interaction, N--W HB interaction is rather weak.

The distances between ions and one of the instantaneous surfaces (blue meshes) for a slab of aqueous LiNO$_3$ solution.}
\end{figure}
For the AIMD trajectory of a solution interface, we can now get instantaneous surface.
For any molecule or ion $\alpha$ in such a solution interface system, we can get its distance from the instantaneous surface.
We assume that the $z$-axis is the normal direction, then the distances between the particle and the instantaneou surfaces are:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
    d_{\alpha,1}(t)=  z^{surf}_{\alpha,1}(t) - z_{\alpha}(t),\label{eq:distance_particle2surf_1}\\
    d_{\alpha,2}(t)= z_{\alpha}(t) - z^{surf}_{\alpha,2}(t), 
\label{eq:distance_particle2surf_2}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $z_{\alpha}(t)$ is the coordinate of the particle $\alpha$ in the normal direction at time $t$, 
$z^{surf}_{\alpha,i}(t)$ is the $z$ coordinate of the surface position corresponding to particle $\alpha$ at time $t$, 
and the subscripts $i=1$ and 2 respectively identify the lower and upper instantaneous surfaces.
As an example, Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:distance_ions2surf_lino3_trimed} shows the distances, 
$d_{\text{Li}^+,1}$ and $d_{\text{NO}_3^-,1}$, between ions and one of the instantaneous surfaces at a certain moment.

Eq.\thinspace\ref{eq:distance_particle2surf_1}. The \emph{distance} here refers specifically to $d_{\alpha,1}$, the distance between the ion 
$\alpha$ and one of the instantaneous surfaces. Distance=0 denotes the instantaneous surface of the interfacial system of LiNO$_3$ solution.}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:prob_dist_li_surf_no3_surf} shows the probability density of the distance between the anion (cation) 
and the instantanous surface in the LiNO$_3$ solution. We found that when the system reaches an equilibrium state, 
the \Li ion is stably within a few angstroms below the interface, while the NO$^-_3$ ion is more willing to be near the surface. 
When the system is in equilibrium ($t>10$ ps), the distance $d_{\text{NO}_3^-,1}$ is around 2 \A, 
which indicates that the nitrate ion is in the top layer the instantanous interface. 
Therefore, the conclusion obtained from the HB dynamics in the instantaneous interface are consistent with that from the 
SFG spectra of the LiNO$_3$ solution.

that of H-bonds at the water/vapor interfaces of the same solutions, 
respectively. For LiI solution, the water molecules bound to the cation ion

 continuum HB lifetime is longer than that of molecules bound to \I or at the interface of the LiI solution.

%Fecko and co-workers' study of liquid D$_2$O by IR spectroscopy reveals that the vibrational dynamics observed are dominated by underdamped displacement of the hydrogen-bond coordinate at very short times ( less than 200 fs).\cite{CJF03,CJF05} 
Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:hbacf_C_sh2_2p} a and b show that the \CHB of H-bonds within the alkali cations and \I decay faster 
than those in bulk water and at the surface of LiI solution. [HOW TO EXPLAIN (a)?]
[(WHAT DOES THIS SENTANCE FOR?)The interface of LiI solution contains H-bonds between water molecules similar to those in bulk water, i.e.,
water molecules participating in these H-bonds are not in the solvation shell of ions.] 
From Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:hbacf_C_sh2_2p}b, we find that, for all three alkali-iodine solutions, the \CHB for hydration shell water molecules 
of \I decays faster than that for molecules at the water/vapor interface.
%The simulation produces similar result as Omta and coworker's experiments of femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy, which demonstrate that anions ( $\text{SO}^{2-}_4$, $\text{ClO}^-_4$, etc) have no influence on the dynamics of bulk water, even at high concentration up to 6 M.\cite{AWO03} 
%Here, we find that the cations \Li and \Na does not alter the H-bonding network outside the first hydration shell of cations. It is concluded that no long-range structural-changing effects for alkali metal cations.
The radii of hydration shells are 5.0 \AA for \li, 5.38 \AA for \na,
5.70 \AA for \pot, and 6.0 \AA for \I ions, which are obtained from the RDFs.
The RDFs $g_{\text{ion-O}}$ (ion=\li, \na) for the interfaces

\paragraph{Effects of the Ion Concentration}
Effects of ions' concentration on HB dynamics have been studied extensively by Chandra. \cite{AC00}
%Pal and coworkers provided details on the structure of water around the micellar surface.\cite{SP05} 
We calculated the \CHB for the water/vapor interfaces of the alkali-iodine solutions, 
and the relaxation time $\tau_{\text{R}}$ for each of them can be determined by 
$C_{\text{HB}}(\tau_\text{{R}})=1/e$.
Here, the \emph{interface} means \emph{all} the water molecules in each model. 
The $\tau_{\text{R}}$ for the water/vapor interfaces of the LiI (NaI) solutions are given in 
Table \ref{tab:tau_hb}. Generally, they are in the range 1--10 ps. 
The values of $\tau_{\text{R}}$ decrease as the concentration of the solutions increases.
\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{\label{tab:tau_hb} 
  The relaxation time $\tau_{\text{R}}$ (unit: ps) of the \CHB  for the water/vapor interface of the LiI (NaI) solutions, calculated by DFTMD simulations.}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
  concentration  & $\tau_{\text{R}}$ (LiI) & $\tau_{\text{R}}$ (NaI) \\
\hline
  0 & 11.50 & 11.50 \\
  0.9 M & 7.04 & 10.60 \\
  1.8 M & 4.40 & 1.96 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The concentration dependence of the HB dynamics can be also found in the \SHB. 
Figure \thinspace\ref{fig:124_2LiI-2NaI_hbacf_S}a gives the \SHB 
for the water/vapor interfaces of 0.9 M and 1.8 M LiI solutions.
The same quantity for NaI solutions is given in Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:124_2LiI-2NaI_hbacf_S}b.
This result indicates that, for the interface of alkali-iodine solution, the continuum HB lifetime  
decrease as the concentration of LiI (or NaI) solution increase.

\section{Ion--Water Hydrogen Bonds}
%
%For the water/vapor interface of alkali-iodine solutions, the $k(t)$ is also calculated.  The result for the interface of 0.9 M LiI solution is shown in Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:hbrf_4pl} (b). The log-log plot of $k(t)$ is not a straight line, indicating that, for water/vapor interface of the LiI solution, this decay does not coincide with a power-law decay, neither.


%{As can be seen from Fig. \ref{fig:hbrf_4pl}, the fluctuations of the $k (t)$ for $d = 2$ \AA (blue solid line) are significantly larger 
%than that of other cases with larger $d$. 
%This phenomenon is due to the relatively small number of water molecules in the thin layer 
%and the insufficient sampling, resulting in large fluctuations in $k(t)$.
%For these four models, as the thickness $d$ of the interface increases, the $k(t)$ gradually converges to a function with smaller fluctuations.
%%
%This conclusion is consistent with the two conclusions we obtained earlier (see Section \ref{sfg_alkali_iodide_interface}): 
%(1) \I is a strong structure-breaking anion; %[\cite{Trevani2000}] 
%(2) compared to pure water, the OH stretching peak at the interface of a solution containing iodide ions will blue shift. [\cite{Tongraar2010}] 
%Comparing these black solid curves, we can see that the interface of the solution containing ions has lower $k(t)$.
%In other words, compared to the pure water interface, 
%the ratio of H-bonds that were initially bonded at the solution interface and broken at time $t$ is lower.
%Because the effect of iodide ions is to increase the $k(t)$ of the interface, the decrease of $k (t)$ of the interface with a larger thickness
%may only be due to the contribution of cations located under the first layer of water molecules at the interface. 
%Therefore, although the iodide ion increases the HB rupture rate at the top layer of the interface, 
%in general, the HB rupture rate of the entire solution interface is reduced due to the presence of cations under the first layer of water molecules. 
%To verify this conclusion, we calculated the $k(t)$ at the interface of NaI (Fig. \ref{fig:hbrf_4pl} (c)) and KI (Fig. \ref{fig:hbrf_4pl} (d)) aqueous solution. 
%The results for both interface systems support our conclusions above.
%}
%\stkout{ What is the differences between bulk and interface? 
%Let us examine the difference in the $k(t)$ between interface water and bulk water. 
%No matter from pure water (Fig. \ref{fig:hbrf_4pl} (a)) 
%or solution (Fig. \ref{fig:hbrf_4pl} (b), (c) or (d)), we find that when the interface thickness is thin, the fluctuation of $k(t)$ is larger.
%Because the thinner the interface, the fewer pairs of water molecules that can form hydrogen bonds. 
%In our calculations, the fewer samples are used to average, so the fluctuation of $k (t)$ is greater. 
%We can find that at the interface of pure water, when $t> 0.2$ ps, the $k(t)$ value of the interface with different thickness is almost equal 
%at any time period $\Delta t$. For example, $\Delta t$ is selected as $\sim$ 2 ps, 
%and its average value is shown in Table \ref{tab:hbrf_neat}. In each time period of 2 ps, the values of $k(t)$ for different layers are approximately equal
%($\pm 0.004$ ps$^{-1}$). Therefore, as far as the nature of HB reactive flux is concerned, the difference between interface and bulk phase of neat water is not obvious. 
%}

%To show the effect of water molecule diffusion on the HB dynamics, we can calculate the sum of the functions $c(t)$ and $n(t)$, i.e., $c(t)+n(t)$.
%Here, we take the LiI solution as an example.
%Fig.\space\ref{fig:124_2LiI_ns20_c_plus_n} shows the time dependence of the correlation functions $c(t)$, $n(t)$ and $c(t)+n(t)$ of the interface of 
%the LiI solution at a concentration of 0.9 M in the AIMD simulation.
%As can be seen, although the change in the total population, $c(t)+n(t)$, is very small in the range of 0--10 ps, it is not a constant.
%Therefore, the $n(t)$ relaxes not only by conversion back to HB \emph{on} state, 
%but is also depleted due to the diffusion process. We can estimate the time scale of water molecule diffusion at the interface of the aqueous solution by $c(t)+n(t) = 1/e$, 
%which is much larger than 10 ps. Therefore, when we analyze the HB dynamics of the solution interfaces, we do not consider the effect of water molecule diffusion.

%

To study the HB dynamics after the transition phase, which is roughly at 0.1 ps (see Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:121}) and lasts for hundreds of picoseconds, 
we set $t_1 = 1$ ps and $t_2 = 10$ ps in the fitting.
For water/vpaor interfaces of neat water and the aqueous solution interfaces, 
the optimal values of $k$ and $k'$ given by these results have been listed in Table \ref{tab:k_k_prime_pure_and_solutions}. 
These values are comparable in magnitude to those obtained by Ref.\thinspace{\cite{Khaliullin2013}}. 
It can be seen from Table \ref{tab:k_k_prime_pure_and_solutions} that the HB breaking reaction rate ($k$) at the interface of pure water is basically equivalent to 
that at the solution interface, but the HB reforming rate ($k'$) is smaller than that at the solution interface by 30\% to 50\%.
Correspondingly, we can find the HB relaxation times of the three solution interfaces are: $\tau=\frac{1}{k+k'} \sim $2.0--2.5 ps. 
For pure water interface, the relaxation time is $\tau \sim $ 3.3 ps. 
Our conclusion is that the difference between the relaxation time of H-bonds at the interface of solutions such as LiI, NaI, KI 
and the interface of pure water is mainly due to the difference in the reforming rate $k'$ of H-bonds caused by the presence of ions,
rather than the difference in the breaking rate $k$ of H-bonds.

  LiI & 0.10 $\pm$ 0.04 & 0.30 $\pm$ 0.05 & 5.33 \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}
As for the effect of water/vapor interface on the HB dynamics in alkali-iodine solutions,
we also calculate the survival probability for interfaces with different sizes of thickness. 
The result for the interface of the LiI solution exhibits that H-bonds at water/vapor interface decay faster than that in bulk water.
The result for the logarithm of \SHB is given in Fig.\space\ref{fig:2LiI-124w_S_layers} in Appendix \ref{thickness_interface}, 
in which the thickness of the alkali-iodine solutions can be determined.
Therefore, as the interface thickness increases, the \SHB converges to a fixed curve, 
which characterizes the HB dynamics of bulk solutions. 
In particular, it gives the average continuum HB lifetime in bulk solutions.
\paragraph{Nitrate--Water H-Bonds}
First, let us take a look at the changes in the hydrogen bond of water by nitrate ions in the bulk solution. 
To achieve this goal, we performed a DFTMD simulation on a system containing one \Li ion, one nitrate ion 
and 127 water molecules, that is, LiNO$_3$ solution. During the simulation, the temperature of the system is 
300 K and the volume is a constant, and periodic boundary conditions are used.
The $\ln{S_{HB}(t)}$ for the water--water H-bonds and nitrate--water H-bonds at the water/vapor interface of the \LiN solution is shown in 
\ref{fig:256_LiNO3_hbacf_sh_no3}. 
The correlation $\ln{S_{\text{HB}}(t)}$ show that
the nitrate--water bonds are weaker than water--water bonds, i.e.,nitrate ions accelerate the dynamical process of H-bonds in water.

Next, how does the nitrate ion affect the H-bonds in the interface?
As shown in Fig.\space\ref{fig:vdos_LiNO3-256w_w_near_nitrate} in chapter ~\ref{CHAPTER_SFG_Calculation}, 
from the VDOS, the water molecules bound to \nitrate have higher OH stretching frequency (55 cm$^{-1}$ larger) 
than those H-bonded to other water molecules. 
%
The difference between nitrate--water and water--water H-bonds 
can be also analyzed in terms of the survival probability $S_{\text{HB}}(t)$, \cite{AKS86,JT90,AL96} 
reported in Fig.\thinspace\ref {fig:256_LiNO3_hbacf_sh_no3}.
The integration of \SHB from 0 to $t_{\max}=5.0$ ps, \cite{Steinel2004} gives the relaxation time $\tau_\text{HB}$, which can be interpreted as 
the average HB lifetime. \cite{SC02} 
The values of $\tau_{\text{HB}}$ is dependent on a temporal resolution $t_t$, during which the H-bonds that break and reform are treated as intact. \cite{AL00} 
%
Here, we choose the temporal resolution as $t_t=1$ fs. 
Then, Fig.\thinspace\ref {fig:256_LiNO3_hbacf_sh_no3} gives $\tau_\text{HB}=0.20$ ps for nitrate--water H-bonds at interfaces, and $\tau_\text{HB}=0.42$ ps for water--water H-bonds.
This result of $\tau_\text{HB}$ is consistent with the experimental result of Kropman and Bakker ($\tau_\text{HB}=0.5\pm0.2$ ps). \cite{MFK01}
The smaller value of $\tau_\text{HB}$ for nitrate--water H-bonds implies that the nitrate--water H-bonds are weaker than bonds between water molecules. 
This is also consistent with the VDOS analysis and the blue-shifted frequency of the OH stretching in the nitrate-water HB. 
%[DELETED From both the VDOS and HB dynamics calculations, we conclude that it is the weak HBs between nitrate and water make the higher surface propensity 
%of nitrate anions, and then induce the depletion of SFG intensity at 3200 \cm for the alkali nitrate salty interfaces.]

%Fig. ~\ref{fig:256_LiNO3_hbacf_Nitrate_effect} shows that the nitrate ions accelerate the HB dynamics at the vapor/water interface of alkali nitrate solution.

\paragraph{I$^-$--Water Hydrogen Bonds in Aqueous Solutions}\label{PARAGRAPH_I--W}
Hydrogen bonds between water molecules and other species also play decisive role in chemical and biological systems. 
For the research of this type of H-bond, some results obtained by molecular simulations have been published. For example,
the HB dynamics of surfactant--water and water--water H-bonds at the air/water interface has been analyzed by Chanda 
and Bandyopadhyay with atomistic molecular dynamics.\cite{Chanda2006} 
Similar analyse for nitrate--water is also done by Yadav, Choudhary and Chandra by first-principles MD simulations.\cite{Yadav2017} 
In the case of water--water H-bonds, the critical distance of $r_\text{OO}^c=3.5$ \AA are the position of the first minimum of the oxygen--oxygen RDF.
For the anion--oxygen H-bonds, we can use the similar criteria. The cutoff values for X--oxygen distance are obtained from the positions of the first
minimum of the X--oxygen RDF, i.e., $R_\text{XO}^c$=4.1, 3.7 \A, for X = I$^-$ (see Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:gdr_124_LiI}b) and nitrate O 
(see Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:gdr_127_LiNO3}b). We have still used $30^{\circ}$ for the anglar cutoff.\cite{Chowdhuri2006}
The function $C_\text{HB}$ of I$^-$--water and water--water H-bonds describes the structural relaxation of these H- bonds. 
The $C_\text{HB}(t)$ are shown in Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:X-O_c_lii_xlogscale}.

The results of the continuous correlation functions for both definitions (ADH and AHD criterions) for the H-bonds are shown in Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:wat-wat_s_lii} 
for I$^-$--water H-bonds. The results of water--water H-bonds are also included for comparison in both Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:wat-wat_s_lii} a and b.
For both definitions of the H-bonds, it is found that the I$^-$--water H-bonds show much faster dynamics than water--water H-bonds. 
(consistent to the previous MD results.)[REF]

%

The time scales of the relaxation of these I$^-$--water H-bonds can be obtained for both definitions. 
In Table \ref{tab:properties_anion-water_hbs}, we have included the average lifetimes $\langle\tau_{a}\rangle$ for I$^-$--water and nitrate--water H-bonds. 
We have performed the fitting in the time region 0.2 ps < $t$ < 12 ps to calculate the forward and backward rate constants for HB breaking.
No matter from ADH or AHD criteria, the average lifetime $\langle\tau_a\rangle$ of I$^-$--water H-bonds is much shorter than that of NO$_3$--water H-bonds.
In addition, based on the HB population operator of ion--molecule pairs, we also calculated the HB lifetimes $1/k$ of these two hydrogen bonds. 
The results show that the lifetime of the I$^-$--water bonds is only half of lifetime of NO$_3^-$--water bonds. Therefore, from the perspective of HB dynamics,
we can draw the following conclusion: I$^-$--water H-bonds and NO$_3^-$--water H-bonds are both weaker than water--water Hbonds. In particular, 
the I$^-$--water bonds is weaker than the NO$_3^-$--water ones.

\section{Solvation Shell Hydrogen Bond Dynamics} \label{SHB_dynamics}
We will extend the IHB dynamics to H-bonds around certain ions, so that we can study the H-bonds in aqueous solutions. 
Similar to the determination of the instantaneous surface, we can define an interface for each molecules in aqueous solutions, that is, 
the first solvation shell of the molecule. Here, we use the word molecule to denote ions, and water molecules.  
Below we will combine the interface defined by the first solvation shell of the ion, 
and Luzar-Chandler's HB population operator \cite{AL96} to calculate the HB
dynamics for the H-bonds between water molecules in the solvation shell of the ion and those outside the shell. 
The dynamics of these H-bonds may vary with the shell radius $r_{shell}$ we had chosen.
From the characteristics of HB dynamics in the solvation shells, we can obtain the effects of various ions on structure and dynamics of aqueous solutions. 

\paragraph{Solvation Shell Hydrogen Bond Population}
Given the solvation shell ${\mathbf k}(t)={\mathbf k}(\{{\mathbf r}_i(t)\})$, we can define the Solvation shell H-Bonds (SHBs).
We use the parameter $r_{shell}$ to denote the radius of the solvation shell.
Now we define the solvation shell HB population operator $h^{k}(t) = h^{k}[{\mathbf r}(t)]$ as follows:
It has a value 1 when the particular tagged molecular pair are H-bonded \emph{and} one of the molecules are inside the solvation shell
with a radius $r_{shell}$, and zero otherwise. 
The definition of $h^{k}(t)$ is very similar to $h^{s}[{\mathbf r}(t)]$, which is defined in \ref{IHBP} for studying the interfacial H-bonds.
Similarly, $h^{k}(t)$ can be uesed efficiently to obtain the dynamic characteristics of H-bonds in solvation shells of any radius. 
The definition of HB here can be based on water molecule pairs or O-H pairs. 
Like in the IHB case, in this paragraph, we just discuss water molecule pair-based H-bonds. 
For the hydrogen bond defined based on the O-H pairs, similar analysis can be done.

Similar to the $C^s_\text{HB}(t)$ for the H-bonds in instantaneous interfaces,
we define the correlation function $C^{k,X}_\text{HB}(t)$ that describes the fluctuation of the solvation shell H-bonds for ion $X$: 
\begin{eqnarray}
C^{k,X}_{\text{HB}}(t)=\langle h^{k,X}(0)h^{k,X}(t) \rangle/\langle h^{k,X}\rangle
\label{eq:C_k_HB}.
\end{eqnarray}
When not considering specific ions, we denote it $C^{k}_\text{HB}(t)$ for short.
%
Similarly, we can define correlation functions 
\begin{eqnarray}
n^{k,X}(t)=\langle h^{k,X}(0)[1-h^{k,X}(t)]h^{(d),k,X} \rangle/\langle h^{k,X}\rangle
\label{eq:n_k_HB},
\end{eqnarray}
and 
\begin{eqnarray}
k^\text{k,X}(t)= -\frac{dC_\text{HB}^\text{k,X}}{dt}
\label{eq:k_k_HB}.
\end{eqnarray}
Then, using these correlation functions, we can determine the reaction rate constants of breaking and reforming and the lifetimes of solvation shell H-bonding.
%
\paragraph{Alkali-Nitrate Solution}
%{Probability Distribution of Ions}
The probability distribution of the ions in the aqueous-vapor interface of  LiI and NaI solutions with repect to the depth of the ions in the solutions (molar concentration: 0.9 M, temperature: 330 K). The distribution indicates that the \I ions prefer to staying at the topmost layer of surface of solutions.
 The probability distribution shows that \I ions tend to the surface of the solutions, while \Na and \Li tend to stay in the bulk. This result is consistent with the calculations from Ishiyama and Morita\cite{TI07,TI14}.

the HB population $h^\text{k}(t)$, as computed from the (a) ADH and (b) AHD criteria of H-bonds.} 
\end{figure}
%The results are obtained from the DFTMD simulation for the bulk LiNO$_3$ solution at $T=300$ K. 
We calculated the HB dynamics of the H-bonds between water molecules in the first solvation shell and other water molecules outside the sphere. 
The choice of the shell radius comes from the RDFs (see Fig.\ref{fig:gdr_NW_WW_127_LiNO3}). Comparing Fig.\ref{fig:256_LiNO3_hbacf_sh_no3} 
and Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:shb_c_ln_bk_Shell_pbc}, we conclude that: Although the HB between nitrate and water molecule is significantly 
weaker than the bond between \Li ion and water molecule under the same conditions,
the HB strength between water molecules in the ions' hydration shells and those outside the shells are not affected by the nature of the ions evidently.
Specificly, Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:shb_c_ln_bk_Shell_pbc} shows that the relaxation process of the H-bonds between the water molecules in NO$^-_3$-shell and 
those outside the shell is \emph{not} faster than the relaxation process of H-bonds between the water molecules in the \Li-shell and those outside the \Li-shell. 

Like $C^s_\text{HB}(t)$, $C^k_\text{HB}(t)$ also accelerates the hydrogen bond kinetics to a certain extent. 
%Therefore, the two are not comparable. 
For example, it can be seen from Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:shb_c_ln_bk_Shell_bulk_wat_pbc_r5} 
that for NO$^-_3$ ion, the $C^{k}_\text{HB}(t)$ decays faster than $C_\text{HB}(t)$ in pure water.

\section{Rotational Anisotropy Decay of Water at the Interface}\label{RAD}
Using the transition dipole auto-correlation function, 
we determined the rotational anisotropy decay and therefore the OH-stretch relaxation at water/vapor interface of alkali iodide solutions.
The effects of ion environment on structure and dynamics of water are obtained by comparing the second-order Legendre polynomial, 
i.e.,  $P_2(x)=\frac{1}{2}(3x^2-1)$,  orientational correlation function of the transition dipole.
The anisotropy decay can be determined from experimental signal in two different polarization configurations---parallel and perpendicular polarizations, by 
\begin{equation}
        R(t)=\frac{S_{\parallel}(t)-S_{\perp}(t)}{S_{\parallel}(t)+2S_{\perp}(t)}
\label{eq:ad}
\end{equation}
where $t$ is the time between pump and probe laser pulses.  The anisotropy decay can also be obtained by simulations, and calculated by the third-order response functions $R(t)$. \cite{Jansen10,Jansen06}
The orientational anisotropy $C_2(t)$ is given by the rotational time-correlation function 
\begin{equation}
C_2(t)=\langle P_2(\hat{u}(0)\cdot\hat{u}(t)) \rangle,
\label{eq:tcf2}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{u}(t)$ is the time dependent unit vector of the transition dipole, $P_2(x)$ is the second Legendre polynomial, and 
$\langle \rangle$ indicate equilibrium ensemble average.\cite{Corcelli05,LinYS2010} %\cite{2010Lin} % angular brackets
The anisotropy decay $C_2(t)$ for the water/vapor interface of neat water is shown in Fig.\space\ref{fig:c2_pure_water_inset}.
The inset shows the first 1 ps of $C_2(t)$, from which we see a quick change during the first $\sim 0.1$ ps primarily due to librations.

\paragraph{\LiN Solution/Vapor Interface}
In the model of the interface, there is one \Li and one \nitrate in the 15.6 \AA$\times$15.6 \AA$\times$31.0 \AA simulation box. 
The aniostropy decay of OH chromophores in water molecules in 0.4 M LiNO3 solution/vapor interface is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:c2_LiNO3_inset}.  
The larger decay rate consistent to the conclusion infered from the VDOS of the interfaces, although the concentration of \LiN is lower. 
This result obtained from another DFTMD trajectory consistent with the previous one, and it reflects that the \nitrate on the surface of the alkali nitrate solution weaken the H-bonds and  accelerate the anisotropy decay of water molecules at the interfaces.

The anisotropy decay $C_2(t)$ for the whole LiI interface of aqueous solution is shown in Fig.\space\ref{fig:c2_2LiI_16_inset}.
This function decays faster than that of neat water, indicating that H-bonds
at the interfaces of alkali-iodine solutions reorient faster than in neat water.

%

We also calculated the $C_2(t)$ for the interface of other alkali-iodine solutions NaI and KI. 
The results of $C_2(t)$ for the water/vapor interfaces of these solutions are shown in Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:c2_2KI_2NaI_2LiI_16}.
In all the cases $C_2(t)$ decays faster than in neat water, indicating that H-bonds
at the interfaces of the three alkali-iodine solutions are orientated faster than that of neat water.
They show that \I ions might accelerate the dynamics of molecular reorientation of water molecules at interfaces. 
Here, we have taken the water molecules in the entire interface as the research object, 
and the calculation results are relatively rough. Therefore, we need careful inspection to verify the above conclusions. 
In other words, we need to investigate the dynamic behavior of water molecules located in the solvation shells of ions.   
%Just from Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:c2_2KI_2NaI_2LiI_16}, we can not infer that the solution with \I ions 
%affect the rotational anisotropy decay of water molecules at interfaces.

We have obtained non-single-exponential kinetics for the rotation of water molecules both at the surface 
and in bulk water (Appendix \ref{single_exp}).
%This result is true for water molecules bound to ions. 
Therefore, the rotational motion of water molecules are not simply characterized by well-defined rate constants. 
Similar non-single-exponential kinetics is also obtained in the HB kinetics
in liquid water \cite{AL96,Dirama2005} and in the time variation of the average frequency shifts of the 
remaining modes after excitation in hole burning technique \cite{Rey2002,Moller2004} and using BLYP functional. \cite{Bankura2014}
Luzar and Chandler interpreted 
the non-single-exponential kinetics as the result of an interplay between 
diffusion and HB dynamics. \cite{AL96} 
We can understand the non-single-exponential kinetics of rotational 
anisotropy decay by fitting the rotational anisotropy decay by a 
biexponential function.


To obtain the effects of diffusion and HB decay of water molecules
in solutions respectively, we assume that there are two independent 
decays in the process of an anisotropy decay. 
Therefore, the correlation function $C_2(t)$ has the form \cite{TanHS05}
\begin{equation}
C_2(t)=A_1e^{-t/\tau_{2,1}} +A_2e^{-t/\tau_{2,2}},
\label{eq:tcf3}
\end{equation}
where $A_i$ are amplitudes and $1/\tau_{2,i}$ are decay rates ($i=1, 2$) of $C_2(t)$. 
Then, the $\tau_{2,i}$ represent the relaxation times of the $C_2(t)$. 
For alkali-iodine solutions (LiI and NaI), the $A_i$ and $\tau_{2,i}$ of the biexponentials fits for 
the $C_2(t)$ are listed in Table ~\ref{tab:2LiI_c2_biexp} and Table ~\ref{tab:2NaI_c2_biexp}.
The biexponential fit is very close to the calculated $C_2(t)$. 
As an example, for the interface system of LiI solution, we made a comparison between $C_2(t)$ 
and the function fitted according to Eq.\thinspace\ref{eq:tcf3},
as shown in Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:2LiI-124w_c2_fit_5ps_biexp}. 
It can be seen that Eq.\thinspace\ref{eq:tcf3} is sufficiently accurate to describe $C_2(t)$ attenuation characteristics.                        
%(compare Fig.\space\ref{fig:2LiI-124w_c2_fit_5_single-exp}).

Let us consider the effect of ion species in solutions on the aniostropy decay of water molecules.
From Table\thinspace\ref{biexponential}, we find that $\kappa_1\sim\kappa_2$ for LiI solution, 
while for NaI solution, $\kappa_1<<\kappa_2$.
The parameters can have the following explanation: $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ describe the time scale of Hydrogen bond dynamics and O---Li (O---Na) bond dynamics, respectively. 
In LiI solution, O---Li bond dynamics and Hydrogen bond dynamics nearly are of the same time scale ($\sim$ 5.0 ps), 
while in NaI solutin,time scale of O---Na bond dynamics ($\sim 0.3$ps) is much shorter than that of HB dynamics ($\sim 11.1$ ps). 

In conclusion, two decay processes exist in the dynamics of water molecules in the alkali halide solution/vapor interface.
The amplitude $\sim$ 1, decay constant $\sim$ 0.1 THz, and for the other describe the initial fast decay of the anisotropy, 
with amplitude $\sim$ 0.1, decay constant $\sim$ (1 $\sim$ 10) THz, due to the inertial-librational motion preceding the orientational diffusion.

\section{Anisotropy Decay in Hydration Shells of Ions}
In this paragraph, we try to verify whether the water molecules in the hydration shell of different ions have different orientation dynamics. 
In addition to the calculation for the alkali-nitrate solution, we also calculated the anisotropic decay in the ion solvation shell of the alkali-iodide solution.
\paragraph{Alkali-Nitrate Solution}
We calculated the anisotropy decay of water molecules in \Li and nitrate ions' hydration shells in the LiNO$_3$ interface. 
The average results of the $C_2(t)$ is shown in Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:C2_ln_itp_pbc}.
The radius of the hydration shell of nitrate O, \Li, and water molecules are taken as 4.0, 2.8 and 3.5 \AA, respectively. 
These values come from the radial distribution functions $g_{\text{N-OW}}(r)$, $g_{\text{Li-OW}}(r)$ and $g_{\text{OW-OW}}(r)$,
for bulk alkali nitrate solution, as shown in Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:gdr_127_LiNO3}a and Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:gdr_NW_WW_127_LiNO3}.
In view of the diffusion of molecules, we only counts trajectories with a duration of 10 ps. The total number of trajectories is 6.

It can be found that in the interfacial systems alkali metal nitrate solution, 
nitrate ions always accelerate the reorientation dynamics of water molecules in the hydration shells of nitrate ions.
However, the reorientation dynamics of water molecules in the hydration shells of alkali metal ions may slowed down 
(for the cases of LiNO$_3$ and NaNO$_3$ solutions, respectively) or accelerated (for the case of KNO$_3$ solution), 
due to the presence of alkali metal ions. 

We find an interesting relation between the reorientation relaxation time and the radius of hydration shell.
For the interface systems of the above three nitrate solutions, the decay rate of the orientation correlation function 
is positively correlated with the radius of the particle's dissolved sphere. To see this dependence, 
we assume that the anisotropy decay is a single exponential given by 
\begin{equation}
C_2(t)=e^{-t/\tau_2},
\label{eq:tcf2}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_2$ is a characteristic relaxation time for the anisotropy decay.
We use this exponential decay function to fit the water molecule correlation function 
and to calculate the $\tau_2$ value corresponding to the solvation shell of different particles. 
We list the calculated values of $\tau_2$ in Table \ref{tab:relaxation_tau_vs_radius_ln}--\ref{tab:relaxation_tau_vs_radius_kn}. 
It can be seen that the reorientaion relaxation time $\tau_2$ of the water molecules in the hydration shell increases with 
the increase of the radius of the hydration shell, and their relationship is shown in Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:ln_nn_kn_tau2_vs_shell_radius}.

\paragraph{Alkali-Iodine Solutions}
The time correlation functions for water molecules bound to specific ions, for selected frequency windows up to 10 ps, are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:2NaI-124w_c2_fit_150223}.
It shows that water molecules bound to \I anions decay fastest,while those bound to \Na slowest. (time range: 0-10 ps).

We obtain non single-exponential kinetics for the rotation of water molecules in both surface and bulk water (and this is true for water molecules bound to ions).
Therefore, the rotational motion of water molecules are not simply characterized by a well-defined rate constant. % or "by well-defined rate constants".
%Then the problem is how to understand the kinetics.
The similar non-exponential kinetics is also obtain in the HB kinetcs in liquid water.\cite{AL96,Dirama2005} 
Luzar and Chandler interpreted the non-exponential kinetics as the result of an interplay between diffusion and HB dynamics \cite{AL96}. 
Here, we try to undertand the non-exponential kinetics of rotational anistropy decay by the model in Eq.\thinspace\ref{eq:tcf3}.

We obtain non-exponential kinetics for the rotation of water molecules in both surface and bulk water (and this is true for water molecules bonded to ions).
Therefore, the rotational motion of water molecules are not simpley characterized by well-defined rate constants. Then the problem is how to understand the kinetics.
The similar non-exponential kinetics is also obtain in the HB kinetcs in liquid water.\cite{AL96,AL96b}  Luzar and Chandler interpreted the non-exponential kinetics as the result of an interplay between diffusion and HB dynamics \cite{AL96}.

\paragraph{Classification of Water Molecules Based on H-Bonds}
We also studied the relation between the anisotropy decay of water molecules and their environment. 
Following the definition used in Ref.\cite{TianCS08}, we use the following labels to denote water molecules in solution: 
$D$ denotes that the water molecule donates a HB, $D'$ donates a H-I bond, and $A$ accepts a H-Bond. \cite{TianCS08} 
$DDAA$ represents a water molecule with two H-Bonds donated to water molecules and two H-Bonds accepted from water molecules (see Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:Multiple_figs}a);
$DD'AA$ represents a water molecule with two HBs donated to a water molecule and \I, and with two H-Bonds accepted from other water molecules 
(see Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:Multiple_figs}c), 
$D'AA$ represents a water molecule bonded to \I at the water/vapor interface and other H-Bonds to water molecules (see Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:Multiple_figs}(d)).
Clearly, we can see that $D'AA$ molecules are of free OH stretching during the dynamics. All four types of water molecules are displayed in Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:Multiple_figs}.

\end{figure} 

It is evident, from our calculations (Fig.\space\ref{fig:2LiI-124w_c2_fit_biexp_7wat_2ps_class_150324}), that the $C_2(t)$ for $DDAA$ and $DD'AA$ molecules do not decay exponentially (Table \ref{tab:fitting_c2_for_each_type_of_water}).
%[BUT Table \ref{tab:fitting_c2_for_each_type_of_water} CAN NOT GIVE THE EVIDENCE. STH. IS MISSING!] 
This result is similar to the reactive flux function $k(t)$, i.e., 
the escaping rate kinetics of H-bonds in bulk water. \cite{Luzar1996} 
The relaxation of H-bonds in water appears complicated, with no simple characterization in terms of a few relaxation rate constants. 
Most of the authors believe that the cooperativity between neighbouring H-bonds, \cite{Sciortino1989, Ohmine1995} or 
self evident coupling between translational diffusion and HB dynamics is the source of the complexity. \cite{Luzar1996} 
However, for $D'AA$ molecules at the interface of the LiI solution,
the $C_2(t)$ decays exponentially, i.e.
\begin{eqnarray}
  C_2(t) &=& C e^{-t/{\tau_2}},\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where the amplitude is $C=0.76$, and the reorientation rate is $1/\tau_2 = 7.14$ ps$^{-1}$.
The single exponential decay of $C_2(t)$ for $D'AA$ molecules, indicates that each $D'AA$  molecule reorientate independently to each other. 

Furthermore, the $C_2(t)$ for $D'AA$ molecules decays much faster than that for $DDAA$ or $DD'AA$ molecules.
From the definitions, the $D'AA$ water molecule accepts two H-bonds and donates only one H-bond, 
while both $DDAA$ and $DD'AA$ water molecules own four H-bonds.
Therefore, the correlation between H-bonds around the $D'AA$ molecule is weaker than those around the $DDAA$ or $DD'AA$ molecule. 
Faster decay of $C_2(t)$ for $D'AA$ molecules shows that the reorientation process of $D'AA$
molecules is much faster than those water molecules in bulk phase, e.g., the $DDAA$, and $DD'AA$ molecules.

Additionally, $D'AA$ water molecule has a free OH chemical bond, which can stretch and vibrate freely. 
This feature is not available in other types of molecules such as DDAA, DD$'$A, DD$'$AA, etc. 
Therefore, on the surface of the solution, the most closely related feature of the molecular orientation relaxation process is 
the number of H-bonds donated by water molecules. Secondly, the type of HB (water--water, or ion--water HB) 
also affects the orientation relaxation process. The number of H-bonds accepted by water molecules has no major effect on the orientation relaxation 
of the water molecules at the interface.
%D'AA 水分子有一个自由的OH化学键，它可以自由地伸缩振动。这个特征是其他类型的分子如DDAA,DD'A, DD'AA等所没有的。因此在溶液表面，与分子取向弛豫过程的快慢关系最密切的特征就是水分子贡献氢键的个数。其次氢键的类型(水与水之氢键，水与离子的氢键等)也影响水分子的取向弛豫过程。水分子所接受的氢键的个数则对界面水分子的取向弛豫不起主要作用。

Finally, for $D'AA$ molecules, the inertial-librational motion can not be seen (Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:2LiI-124w_c2_fit_biexp_7wat_2ps_class_150324} 
and Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:2LiI-124w_c2_fit_biexp_7wat_2ps_2021}). 
This result implies that the rotational anisotropy decay of $D'AA$ molecules
are of the same time scale of the inertial libration, i.e., $\sim$ 0.2 ps. 
This conclusion can be verified from the value of $\tau_{2,1}$ in Table \ref{tab:fitting_c2_for_each_type_of_water}: $\tau_{2,1}=0.14$ for D$'$AA, 
which is smaller than the $\tau_{2,1}$ for DDAA, DD$'$A, and DD$'$AA.

Rotational anisotropy decay of water molecules is found at the interface of LiI solution. 
The result comes from a different HB types from the usual $DDAA$ HB type in pure bulk water.
The faster anisotropy decay for $D'AA$ molecules reflects the less correlation between different H-bonds for $D'AA$ molecules, 
which comes from Hydrogen--Iodide bond at the interfaces, the existence of free OH stretching.
From Fig.\space\ref{fig:prob_124_LiI_double_axis}, we have known that in the LiI solution, 
\I ions prefer to locate at the water/vapor interface.  
Therefore, we infer that the reduction of the inter-correlations between H-bonds occurs at the water/vapor interfaces. 

[RIGHT?]Slower rotational anisotropy decay exists for water molecules  at the water/vapor interface of the alkali-iodide solutions, 
which is the result of a different H-Bond types ($D'AA$) from $DDAA$-type molecules in pure bulk water. 
The slowing down of anisotropy decay is the effects of Hydrogen-Iodide bond at the interface. 
Since the iodide's surface perpensity is high, this difference of H-Bond structure from pure water/vapor interface changed 
the Im$\chi^{(2)}$ spectrum and the total H-Bond dynamics of the interface of alkali-iodide solutions.  
The effects of Hydrogen-Iodide bond on the H-Bond dynamics at the interfaces, 
and the relation between the interfacial H-Bond dynamics and rotational anisotropy decay can also be studied in the future.

%
In conclusion, single exponential type rotational anisotropy decay exists for water molecules at the water/vapor interface of the alkali-iodine solutions,
and this faster anisotropy decay of water molecules at the water/vapor interface is the effects of free OH strech and Hydrogen--Iodide (H--I) bond at the interface, i.e., 
the D$'$AA molecules. 
Since the iodide's surface propensity is high, this difference of HB structure 
from neat water/vapor interface is the source of 
the HB dynamics as well as the Im$\chi^{(2)}$ spectrum of the interface of alkali-iodine solutions.  
We believe that using similar classification method for water molecules, on the basis of AIMD simulations, 
the orientation correlation function $C_2(t)$ of water molecules in other kinds of solution interfaces can also be analyzed.
%我们相信，利用这种对水分子的的分类方法，在AIMD模拟的基础上，也可其他种类的溶液界面中的水分子取向关联函数作分析。

%\subsection{\LiN Solution/vapor Interface}
%The anisotropy decay of OH bonds in water molecules in 0.4 M LiNO3 solution/vapor interface is shown in Fig.\space\ref{fig:c2_LiNO3_inset}.  In the model of the interface, there is one \Li and one \nitrate in the 15.6 \AA$\times$15.6 \AA$\times$31.0 \AA simulation box. 
%The larger decay rate consistent to the conclusion infered from the VDOS for the interfaces, although the concentration of \LiN is lower. This result obtained from another DFTMD trajectory consistent with the previous one, and it reflects that the \nitrate on the surface of the alkali nitrate solution weaken the H-bonds and  accelerate the anisotropy decay of water molecules at the interfaces.
