\chapter{VSFG spectroscopy of the water/vapor and solution/vapor interfaces}\label{CHAPTER_SFG}
In Chapter \ref{CHAPTER_Clusters}, we investigated the VDOS for water clusters containing nitrate and alkali metal ions.
We found that small clusters cannot be directly used to model interfaces of aqueous solutions,
and we need to build more realistic ones to capture the main features of interfaces.
In this chapter, we will analyze the structure and dynamics of solutions containing an alkali cation and a nitrate (iodide) ion and to provide 
a microscopic interpretation of recent experimental results\cite{Salvador2003,Jubb2012,HuaWei2014}. 

The goal of this chapter is to find the origin of the main characteristics of the VSFG spectrum of the \LiN solution,
and provide a molecular picture to interpret the recorded spectra.
To achieve this goal, we simulate a solution/vapor interface including \Li and \nitrate
(Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:interface_chandler}),
and extract the vibrational spectroscopic properties of the interface.

\end{figure}

We consider a model for the interface where a slab of 256 water molecules containing one \Li and 
one \nitrate (LiNO$_3$(H$_2$O)$_{256}$) is included in a periodic simulation box of 19.70 $\times $ 19.70 $\times $ 40.00 \A$^3$ at 300 K.
The slab is 20 \AA thick and infinite in the \X and \Y direction, while the
separation between the periodic slabs in the \Z direction is 20 \A.
The  \LiN was inserted at one of the two interfaces, with the \nitrate residing in the topmost layer and 
the \Li residing somewhat deeper at about 5 \AA from the surface. In this way we have a model with one \emph{salty} interface
and one \emph{neat} interface which can be used as a reference.  
To provide the interpretation to the above experimental results, the following analysis tools are used:
(1) VDOS; 
(2) calculation of the nonlinear susceptibility; 
(3) reconcile of the interface and cluster picture.
In Paragraph \ref{sfg_ln}, the VSFG spectrum of the alkali nitrate interface of  aqueous solutions is calculated,
to find the connection between these two kind of models: the interface and cluster picture.
Additionally, to study the effect of cations, interfaces of alkali iodide solutions are also studied in Paragraph \ref{sfg_alkali_iodide_interface}.

\section{VSFG spectra of the lithium nitrate solution/vapor interface}\label{sfg_ln}
% MAIN STATEMENT p1: LiNO3 forms a stable water separated ion pair at the interface.
% p1a: NO3- is on the surface.
It has been often put forward the idea that in nitrate solution anion and cation are paired 
at the interface and form a double layer. Based on the relatively high propensity of \nitrate for the interface\cite{Otten2007}
we decided to start DFTMD simulations with the anion at the water surface and to investigate the possibility that  \LiN
forms a stable water-separated ion pair at the interface. The idea that nitrate ions form water-separated pair where
the Coulomb interaction is shielded was already suggested for divalent cation nitrate\cite{XuM2009}.
%An equilibration time of about 10 ps was considered before the trajectory analysis, and subsequently 40 ps have been considered for production. 
The first result is that
such model system is stable and the \nitrate remains within the topmost water layer during all the simulation time.
This result can be found in the probability distribution along $z$-axis of the simulation box (Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:prob_LiNO3-wat--256_LiNO3_double_axis}).
This is in agreement with previous simulation results based on polarizable classical force field\cite{DJT13}
and also with some DFTMD work on nitric acid, which was also found stable at the interface\cite{Shamay2007}. 
Moreover, the \Li remains relatively close to the surface, in a water sub-layer forming a water separated ion pair 
with \nitrate at the interface.

% p2: The interface LiNO3 has depletion in 3200 cm-1 in SFG
% p1 => p2
We have calculated the nonlinear susceptibility for the two interfaces, namely the one containing the \LiN pair (salty interface) 
and the neat one which does not include any ion. 
%The SFG signal is calculated by Eq. ~(\ref{eq:chi}):
%\begin{align}
%  \chi^{(2)}_{SSP,\text{R}}&=\frac{i}{k_BT \omega} \sum\limits_j \int_0^\infty dt e^{i\omega t} \frac{\partial A_{XX}}{\partial r_j} \frac{\partial M_Z}{\partial r_j} \langle \dot{r}_j(0) \dot{r}_j(t) \rangle \nonumber
% \end{align}
%where $r_j$ is the length of the OH bond, %(i.e., the vibrational coordinate of the $j$th normal mode),
%$X, Y, Z$ denote the axes of Cartesian coordinates in space, $A$ is the polarizability,  and $M$ the transition dipole moment.
%
%This VDOS can be seen as the resonant second order susceptibility 
%($\chi^{(2)}_{SSP,\text{R}}$) of a system having an VSFG signal only based (1) on the bond stretching 
%(2) without any correlation between the different bonds and (3) with a fully isotropic polarizability. 
%These approximations are valid, since (1) we are focusing only on the stretching region of water, 
%(2) no splitting between the symmetric and antisymmetric stretching is expected, 
%(3) the total polarizability of water is nearly isotropic.\cite{Salanne08}.
%The main advantage of such approximation for $\chi^{(2)}_{\text{R}}$ is that it retain details of the
%water/vapor interfaces including the full electronic structure, but its computational
%cost is reduced with respect to a full calculation with the instantaneous evaluation of the 
%molecular dipoles and polarizabilities\cite{Sulpizi13}.
% p5: for the top 1 \AA, free OH region is less intense.
% p6: for the top 1\AA, Free OH is less than neat water surface
% p1a: NO3- is in the region of top 1\AA (or NO3- is on the surface). p5 => p6, p6 => p1a.
The calculated imaginary part is reported in panel a and the intensity in panel b of  
Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:sfg_LiNO3_7A_20ps_gauss150}. The calculated intensity spectra show a depletion of 
the 3200 \cm region as in the experiments (Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:Allen12}).
%which is the experimental result of the VSFG intensity of the alkali nitrate interfaces) 
The same feature is also shown in the imaginary part. 
Also the calculated spectra show that the free OH region is less intense in the salty interface with respect to the water/vapor interface.

%The simulation time is 40 ps and the $d$=9 \A. 
%Note:
%The simulation system is \Li ion, 1 \nitrate ion, and 256 water molecules in 19.7 $\times $ 19.7 $\times $ 40.0 \A$^3$ simulation box.

To find the microscopic origin of the depression of the lower frequency region,
we have also decomposed the salty water interface VDOS into the contributions coming from the different water molecules. 
%======================================================VDOS========================
%{Discuss the difference between the two interfaces using the VDOS--- Lore Sulpizi}
%To explore the ion-induecd effect in the interface, 
The VDOS $g_z(\nu)$ for the water molecules at the interface, which is calculated from the FT of atoms' ACF 
of velocity in the $z$-axis projection, gives a rough value of the thickness $d$ of the interface. 
Using 1, 2 and 5 \AA thicknesses, we have defined three different interfacial regions. 
For the LiNO$_3$ solution, $g_z(\nu)$ of the salty and neat water interfaces in the slab is reported in Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:surf_x-vs-l_x_d1-5}.
When $d$ is equal to 1 \A, water molecules at the solution surface have lower free OH stretching frequency than that in pure water.
This means that there are less water molecules with free OH stretch at the interface of \LiN solution than at the water/vapor interface. 
It compares very well with the experimental result of the surface propensity of nitrate anions in water solution\cite{Salvador2003}.
Meanwhile, compared to the result of the water/vapor interface, the H-bonded band of the VDOS for the salty interface has a blue shift of $\Delta\nu\approx 80$ \centimeter.
As we increase the value of $d$, the difference between the VDOS of the water/vapor and solution/vapor interface is gradually reduced. 
When $d$ is equal to 2 \A, the amount of blue shift $\Delta\nu$ reduces to 55 \centimeter (Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:surf_x-vs-l_x_d1-5} b); 
when $d$ is 5 \A, $\Delta\nu$ is almost zero (Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:surf_x-vs-l_x_d1-5} c).
This tendency indicates that ions' (\li, \na, \K and \nit) effects 
can be found only on the water molecules in the top $\sim$5-\AA layer of the interface.
% p3: l=1A, peak of g_z for the interface is blue-shifted.
As the thickness of the interfacial water layer included in $g_z(\nu)$ increases, the free OH signal is depressed
and at the same time the H-bonded OH bands for the salty and neat water interfaces become more similar.
%To check the convergence of the dynamics of the system, $g_z(\nu)$ is calculated for the first half 10 ps 
%and the later half second 10 ps, respectively. (see Fig.\ref{fig:FT_all_w_in_interf})

  (solid line) and at the water/vapor interface (dashed line). (a): $d=1$ \A; (b): $d=2$ \A; (c): $d=5$ \A.}
\end{figure}
%

To explore the reason for the blue shift of the H-bonded OH stretch at the interface,
we also calculated the VDOS $g(\nu)$ for the six water molecules in the subsystems NO$_3^-$(H$_2$O)$_6$
(the structure of this cluster is shown in Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:interface_chandler}).
Compared to the VDOS for H-bonded water molecules at the water/vapor interface, a blue shift of $\Delta\nu' \approx 80$ \cm on the vibrational modes 
of water molecules is found at the interface (Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:vdos_LiNO3-256w_w_near_nitrate}).
It indicates that a HB with nitrate acceptor (nitrate--water bond) is weaker than that with water acceptor (water--water bonds), 
since the amount of O--H frequency shift reflects the strength of the H-bonds\cite{Pimentel1960,Morita2000}. 
This feature agrees with experimental result obtained by Jubb \etal\cite{Jubb2012}.  
The OH stretching band at 3394 \cm(for $T=300$ K) also agrees with that of liquid pure water (3400 \centimeter\cite{Marechal2011}).
Since $\Delta\nu'$ is almost equal to $\Delta\nu$ for the case of $d=1$ \A, we conclude that the blue shift of the VDOS 
at the salty water interface is mainly caused by the H-bonds between the uppermost nitrate and water molecules at the solution/vapor interface.
% Extra info
% In VDOS for water molecules bound to \nitrate in the water/vapor interface 
% and to water molecules in the interface system as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:vdos_LiNO3-256w_w_near_nitrate},
% there is no 3700 \centimeter-peak, all the water molecules considered are H-bonded either to  \nitrate or \wat. 
% Therefore, for the bonded water molecules, those bonded to \nitrate have higher OH stretching frequency (3455 \centimeter) 
% than that (3400 \centimeter) of water molecules H-bonded to \wat.

\end{figure} 

% p1a => p6 => p5
First, there are two reasons to support the view that \nitrate is located at the top layer of the surface.
(1) The reduced intensity of the free OH peak can be explained by that \nitrate is at the surface.
The 3700 \centimeter-peak is the character of free OH stretch in water molecules with 
their dipole moment pointing to the vapor phase\cite{DuQ1993,Baldelli1997}. 
\nitrate binds to water molecules from the water surfaces which have less free OH, therefore reduce the intensity of the free OH peak.
% p3 => p1a
%p3:
(2) Those water molecules directly H-bonded to the \nitrate ion show an higher frequency band with respect to the neat 
water at the interface, which explain the increased intensity of the 3400 \cm band.
%It is the water molecules H-bonded to \nitrate cause the blue shift in the VDOS $g_z$. 

% p1b: separated pair
Second, the statement that \Li and \nitrate are separated is confirmed by Ref. \cite{Pegram2006,Pegram2008},
which show that the alkali metal cations are of \emph{small}
composite partition coefficients ($k_{p,\text{K}^+} = 0.00\pm 0.03$, $k_{p,\text{Na}^+} = 0.05\pm 0.17$, $k_{p,\text{Li}^+} = 0.14\pm 0.18$), i.e., 
these cations are more surface-excluded than 
NO$_3^-$ ($k_{p,\text{NO}_3^-} \approx 1.0$).
How do we reconcile the interface picture and the cluster picture?
In the small clusters (with 3, 4 and 5 water molecules) the contact ion pair is the most stable configuration, 
while at the interface the water \emph{separated} configuration is the most stable.
This result suggests that a sufficiently large number of water molecules is required to stabilize a water separated ion pair where
\nitrate still reside at the surface. 
To verify this idea we extracted a relatively large cluster with 30 water molecules from the full interface, centered
around the \Li ion and we simulate it in the gas phase. 
For this medium size cluster we calculated the free energy difference between the
water separated and the contact ion pair. The details of the calculation is given in Appendix \ref{calculate_free_energy}. 
%[REMOVED: We find a very small free energy difference (0.3 kcal/mol) 
%in favor of the water separated ion pair. 
%In the interface system, the relation between free energies of different configurations 
%can give us the explain of the vibrational properties of water molecules. 
%Consider a cluster including an alkali metal cation, a nitrate anion and more water: LiNO$_3$(H$_2$O)$_{30}$.]
The blue-moon ensemble method\cite{Carter1989,Sprik1998,Tuckerman10} is used to calculate the free energy as a function of  
the distance $r$ between alkali metal cation and the nitrogen of \nitrate in LiNO$_3$(H$_2$O)$_{30}$.
We find that (Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:Li-nitrate-32w_free-ener})
there are two minima in the free energy
at $r=2.9$ \AA (configuration A)  and $r=4.3$ \AA(configuration B).
\Li and \nitrate are bonded in configuration A, but are water-separated in configuration B.
The free energy difference $\Delta{F}_{\text{AB}}=F_{\text{A}}-F_{\text{B}}$ is equal to 0.3 kcal/mol. 
%We use C denotes the transition state. 
The energy barrier between C and A (B) is
$\Delta{F_{\text{CA}}} = 1.2$ kcal/mol ($\Delta F_{\text{CB}} = 1.5$ kcal/mol), i.e., configuration B is more stable than A.
% [REMOVED: This result interprets the probability that the system is in configuration B is larger than in A.]
For the interface system, \nitrate resides on the surface and \Li in the layer below, separated from \nitrate by water molecules.
Therefore, no obvious red-shift induced by alkali metal cation and nitrate is obtained in the VSFG spectrum.
Our results show that as the number of waters increases, the first solvation shell around the \Li is stabilized and 
the water separated ion pair is equally stable as the contact ion.
%ALSO: In the medium size cluster, the \nitrate resides at the surface of the cluster as in the full interface.

% p1c: one single water is constantly shared between the \Li and the \nitrate
% p8: The water (bound to both Li and \nitrate<0) shows a vibrational peak with a very pronounced red shift
Finally, at the salty interface, one single water is constantly shared between the \Li and the \nitrate and indeed 
this water shows a vibrational peak with a very pronounced red shift. This clearly reminds the water peak we already observed 
in the small clusters, however if the full interface is considered its signature do not emerge from the spectra, as it can be 
seen in Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:sfg_LiNO3_7A_20ps_gauss150}.

From the three arguments above, our conclusion is thus that in the VSFG spectrum we do only see the changes induced by the \nitrate at the interface.
This points to a clear 3400 \cm band in the vibrational spectra.
The \Li resides in the sub-layer forming a water separated ion pair at the interface.

Until now, we have analyzed the behaviour of a salty interface containing \LiN.
Both the measured and calculated VSFG spectra show a reduced intensity of the lower frequency portion of
the HB region, namely around 3200 \centimeter, when compared to the water/vapor interface. 
This reduction can be attributed to the H-bonds which are established between the \nitrate and the surrounding water molecules at the interface.
This effect is only related to the presence of \nitrate at the water surface and is not affected by the \Li ions.
Indeed we have shown that although \Li can reside relative close to the water surface, also forming a water mediated
ion pair with \nit, its effect on the VSFG spectrum is not visible. The water which mediate the interaction 
between the \nitrate and \Li ions would produce a red-shifted peak in small water cluster, but its influence is not visible 
neither in the calculated or the measured VSFG spectra. We have also shown that the very simple models,
such as small clusters are not suitable to reproduce the experimental spectra and cannot provide a microscopic interpretation of the spectra. 
A realistic model of the interface is required to address the perturbation of the ion on the water surface.
Besides, how do other ions, such as \li, \na, and K$^+$, affect the VSFG spectra of the interface? 
To apply our method and explain the experimental observations, we constructed the interface of lithium iodide,
 sodium iodide, and potassium iodide solutions and calculated the VSFG spectra. 
Experiments have proved that iodide ions have similar properties to nitrate ions in many aspects. 
For example, they tend to the interface and are easily polarized. 
On the other hand, when we analyze the effects of cations, the model containing iodide ions is more simplified than the model containing nitrate ions.

\section{VSFG spectra of the alkali iodide solution/vapor interfaces}\label{sfg_alkali_iodide_interface} %Solutions LiI, NaI, KI
Direct investigations of the dynamics of simple ions, such as \I and \br, at water interfaces, 
by the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy\cite{Ghosal2005} and MD simulations\cite{Jungwirth2001,Jungwirth2002} 
have shown that these ions could accumulate at the interface.
To provide a molecular interpretation of the recorded spectra we performed AIMD simulations of salty solutions containing alkali metal cations
and iodide. % MS modified

A model for the electrolyte solution/vapor interface is built, in which a slab of 118 water molecules containing two \Li cations and 
two \I anions is included in a period simulation box of 15.60 $\times $ 15.60 $\times $ 31.00 \A$^3$ (0.9 M). % MS added
The slab is about 20 \AA thick and infinite in the \X and \Y direction, while the separation between the periodic slabs 
in the \Z direction is about 20 \AA. 
In the initial configuration, the LiI was inserted at one of the two interfaces, with the \I residing in the topmost 
layer and the \Li residing somewhat deeper at about 5 \AA from the surface. 
Using the same method, we also constructed interface models of NaI and KI solutions for DFTMD simulations.
%For \Na, we use the Gaussian and Augmented-Plane-Wave (GAPW) method, where the electronic density is partitioned 
%in hard and soft contributions. The hard contributions are local terms naturally expanded in a Gaussian basis, whereas 
%the soft parts are expanded in plane-waves by using a low energy cutoff, without loss in accuracy. \cite{Iannuzzi05}  
%GAPW is a hybrid method.
In all the cases the systems were equilibrated for 30 ps and then a production time of 60 ps was considered for the analysis.
% MS moved it here.

% Thus, the effects of \Li on susceptibility of the water molecules is canceled. 
%
First, we have calculated the probability distributions of \li, \I and O with respect to 
the normal direction ($z$-axis) of the LiI solution surface. 
We see that the \I anions prefer to be located at the surface of the 
solution, while the \Li cations prefer to stay below the surface (Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:prob_124_LiI_double_axis}). 
This result is consistent with the calculations by 
Ishiyama and Morita\cite{TI07,Ishiyama2014} on a similar system. 
%The ions distribution affects the orientation of water molecules in the interface system. % MS removed this sentence.

The effects of \Li and \I on the organization of water molecules are shown in Li--water (Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:gdr_124_LiI} a) 
and I--water RDFs (Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:gdr_124_LiI} b), respectively.  
In Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:gdr_124_LiI} a, the first two peaks of $g_{\text{Li-O}}$ and $g_{\text{Li-H}}$ are located at 1.97 \AA and 4.12 \ \A,  
and, 2.61 \AA and 4.73 \ \A, respectively. 
Here we consider the \emph{difference} $\delta_1$ between the first peaks' positions of $g_{\text{X-O}}$ and $g_{\text{X-H}}$. 
Thus, one can determine the differences of the peaks' positions, which are shown in Table \ref{tab:gdr_Li-water}. 
The difference $\delta_1$ between the first peaks, 0.67 \A, is shorter than the OH bond length $R_{\text{OH}}$ in a water molecule which is about 0.98 \A, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
\delta_1 < R_{\text{OH}}.
\label{lt_OH}
\end{equation}
This relation reflects that all the water molecules around \Li have their O atom facing \li. 
Similarly, the distance $\delta_1$ between the first peaks of the 
two RDFs is $0.93$ \A, and it can be seen that $\delta_1$ is slightly equal to $R_{\text{OH}}$ (about 0.98 \A)
(Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:gdr_124_LiI} b), i.e., 
\begin{equation}
\delta_1 \approx R_{\text{OH}}.
\label{almost_OH}
\end{equation}
This relation shows that for the water molecules around I$^-$, only one H atom forms an I--H bond with I$^-$. 
This relation also implies that \I is essentially at the outermost layer of the solution interface. 
This is consistent with many of the previous results from MD simulations\cite{Dang2002,Jungwirth2001} 
and experimental results for the increase in surface tension relative to neat water for aqueous solutions of sodium halide salts\cite{Jungwirth2002,Vrbka2004,Garrett2004,Bajaj2016}.

For the NaI and the KI interfaces, the effects can be seen from Fig.s\thinspace\ref{fig:gdr_124_NaI} and \ref{fig:gdr_124_KI}. For \Na and K$^+$, 
the relation $\delta_1 < R_{\text{OH}}$ remains,
i.e., $\delta_1$ is equal to 0.61 \AA for \Na and $\delta_1$ is 0.56 \AA  for K$^+$.
For \I, the relation $\delta_1 \approx R_{\text{OH}}$ still holds (Fig.s\thinspace\ref{fig:gdr_124_NaI} a and \ref{fig:gdr_124_KI} a,
and Tables \ref{tab:gdr_Na-water} and \ref{tab:gdr_K-water}). For \I in the NaI interface, $\delta_1$ is equal to 0.96 \A; 
and for \I in the KI interface, $\delta_1$ is 0.94 \AA (Fig.s\thinspace\ref{fig:gdr_124_NaI} b and \ref{fig:gdr_124_KI} b).
Therefore, these structural properties are similar to that in the LiI interface, except the larger solvation shells.

\paragraph{VSFG spectra}
%We have calculated the susceptibility for the two interfaces, the one containing the LiI pair 
%and the neat one which does not include any ion.
%As we assumed in chapter 3, there is no time dependence of the dipole/polarisability components, therefore, 
%only the value at $t=0$ is taken into account. 
%The expression for the VSFG spectrum is :
The calculated VSFG spectra for the LiI, NaI and KI interfaces, are shown in Fig.s\thinspace\ref{fig:sfg_118_2LiI_both_50ps_gauss150} to \ref{fig:sfg_118_2KI_both_50ps_gauss150}. 
In all the cases there is one free OH stretching band (3600--3800 \centimeter) and one bonded OH stretching band (3000--3600 \centimeter).
These features are the same as that of the water/vapor interface.
%For NaI solution surface, in the region 3600--3800 cm$^{-1}$, Im$\chi^{(2),\text{R}}_{SSP}>0$ is obtained, and it is in 
%agreement with experiments for NaI solutions.\cite{JiN08,TianCS2011,Verreault2013}
%The LiI and KI solutions, exhibit similar characteristics, and in term of Im$\chi^{(2),\text{R}}_{SSP}$ and $|\chi^{(2),\text{R}}_{SSP}|^2$ spectra, they are not significantly different from the NaI 
%solution except for the above characteristics.
%[In the experimental results, NaI solution also exhibits an Im$\chi^{(2),\text{R}}_{SSP}$ spectrum in which the magnitude is positive over the frequency region 3000--3400 cm$^{-1}$. Which one is closer to the reality of the NaI interface?]
%This peak is usually regarded as the consequence of water molecules in the icelike region and it decreases as the temperature increases. \cite{Shen2006} 
%Our DFTMD simulations are done at 330 K, therefore the icelike peak is not visible in the Im$\chi^{(2),\text{R}}_{SSP}$ spectrum.
%This red shift suggests that the I--H bonds are apt to be located at the surface of the three aqueous solutions and thus the number of free OH stretching OH bonds is reduced.

%This red shift suggests that the I--H bonds are apt to be located at the surface of the three aqueous solutions and thus the number of free OH stretching OH bonds is reduced.
The sign of $\Im\chi^{(2),\text{R}}$ is positive for the free OH peak while it is negative in the H-bonded region. % MS modified 
This result is consistent with the VSFG spectrum calculated in Paragraph \ref{sfg_ln}, i.e., 
(1) the anion--water bonds at interfaces decrease the amount of free stretching OH bonds 
(2) the free stretching peak in the intensity of VSFG spectrum decrease and the H-bonded stretching peak is shifted at the interfaces of LiNO$_3$ (or alkali iodide) solution.

%The spectra of the NaI solution interface are quite different compared to that of LiI and KI solutions. 
%Moreover, the spectrum of the NaI solution interface is closer to the VSFG spectrum of the interface of pure water, 
%that is, in addition to the influence of iodide ions, we verify the result by the calculation of the nonlinear polarizability, that is, 
%the effect of \Na on the spectrum at the aqueous solution interface is weaker than that of both lithium and potassium ions. 


Compared with the water/vapor interface, the H-bonded peak of $|\chi^{(2),\text{R}}_{SSP}|^2$ for the NaI solution is blue-shifted, 
which is consistent with experimental results on the NaI solution\cite{Raymond2004,TianCS2011,LiuDingfang2004,Jubb2012}.
The H-bonded OH-stretching peak of $|\chi^{(2),\text{R}}_{SSP}|^2$ for the LiI and the KI solutions are also blue-shifted. 
These results support the idea that \I is a strong structure-breaking anion.   
Secondly, the bonded OH-stretching region of the NaI solution is narrower than that of pure water. 
This result has also been obtained for the interface of the LiNO$_3$ solution.
The retained high frequencies of these bonded OH-stretching peaks indicate that these molecules at the interfaces of these solutions are participating in weak H-bonding. 
The introduction of \I, caused a slight decrease in the strong H-bonding region at 3200 \cm and relatively an increase 
in the weak H-bonding region at 3400 \centimeter.  This result is consistent with experimental results in Ref.\cite{LiuDingfang2004,Jubb2012}. 

Because of surface isotropy of the solutions\cite{Shultz2000}, the $\chi^{(2),\text{R}}_{SSP}$ can be calculated either 
through $\chi^{(2),\text{R}}_{XXZ}$, or $\chi^{(2),\text{R}}_{YYZ}$. 
Here we report the comparison between $\Im\chi^{(2),\text{R}}_{XXZ}$ and
$Im\chi^{(2),\text{R}}_{YYZ}$ for the KI solution in 
Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:sfg_118_2KI_both_50ps_gauss150_330K_xxz_yyz}. 
They should be very close to each other, because the interfaces have rotational symmetry about the $z$-axis.
It can be seen that the calculated spectra are very close to each other.
From the results of the nonlinear susceptibilities, we conclude that water molecules at the interfaces of the LiI, NaI, and KI solutions are participating 
in weaker H-bonds, compared with those at the water/vapor interface. 
The simulation results permit to interpret the features present in the experimental spectra, 
which can be explained as consequence of the double layer formed by \I on
the topmost water layer and the alkali ion in the sublayer. % MS modified
Therefore, the VSFG experimental characteristics on alkali nitrate and alkali iodide solutions can be reproduced 
from our calculation method, which verifies the reliability of the method used in the current thesis to calculate VSFG spectra.

In view of the close relationship between the HB network and the VSFG spectra of solution interfaces, 
we will continue to study the properties of the water/vapor interface and the solution/vapor interface from the perspectives of HB dynamics and reorientation of water molecules 
in Chapters \ref{CHAPTER_HBD} and \ref{CHAPTER_HBD_Solutions}.

%\section{Instantaneous Interfaces of  Water/Vapor Interfaces}
%We have tried a different layering method for the solution/vapor interfaces: plane layering and instantaneous layering.
%Based on the density distribution, we determined the surface of the solutions. 
%In the plane layering method, we assume that the surface is a plane, and we calculate the Im$\chi^{(2)}$ spectra for layers with different thicknesses. This is what we did in the above sections.
%This section, we use the second layering method to study water/vapor interfaces.
