\chapter{Computational details of the DFTMD simulations}\label{computational_detail}
The DFT calculations were done with the CP2K program\cite{CP2K,Kuehne2020}, which incorporates the Gaussian and Plane Waves (GPW) method\cite{Lippert1999}. 
Core electrons were described by Goedecker-Teter-Hutter pseudopotentials\cite{Goedecker1996,MK05}, while valence electrons were expanded as a double-zeta Gaussian basis set\cite{VandeVondele2007}. 
The cutoff for the auxiliary plane wave basis was set to 280 Ry.
The discretized integration time step $\Delta t$ was set to 0.5 fs. 
The Brillouin zone was sampled at the $\Gamma$-point only and, the BLYP XC functional has been employed.
All simulations for the water/vapor interface and aqueous solutions were performed within the canonical ensemble. 
%
\paragraph{Bulk water}\label{DETAILS_NEAT_WATER}
%In addition to the simulation in the main text of this thesis, we also use different methods for bulk water system with the same temperature,
%volume and number of molecules. 
To simulate bulk water, we constructed the following model. 
The number of water molecules in the simulation system is 128, 
the temperature is $T=300$ K, and the box is a cube with a side length of 15.64 \A. 
In this simulation, we relax the value of the target accuracy for the SCF convergence to 10$^{-6}$. 
The size of the simulation box is obtained as follows: 
According to the experimentally obtained relations between water density, temperature and ion concentration (if ions are present), 
a nonlinear equation set is established, and then the equation set is solved to find the box size.

\paragraph{Lithium nitrate solutions}\label{DETAILS_LINO3}
The simulated interfacial system consisted of 127 water molecules and a Li$^+$--nitrate pair in a periodic
box of size $15.78 \times 15.78 \times 31.56$ \A$^3$, which corresponds to
a density of 0.997 g/cm$^3$. 
At each DFTMD step the corrector was applied only once, which implies just one preconditioned gradient calculation. 
For a given molecular configuration, $\{\mathbf{r}_i (t)\}$, Eq.\thinspace\ref{eq:rho_c} can be
solved through interpolation on a spatial grid\cite{Willard2010}. 
We have taken $\{\mathbf{r}_i (t)\}$ to refer to the positions of all
atoms except hydrogen atoms in the system, and because bulk correlation length of
liquid water is about one molecular diameter, we have used $\xi$ 
=2.4 \AA; further, we have used $\rho_0= 0.016$ \A$^{-3}$, which is
approximately one-half the bulk density of water. 

The calculation of the $\chi^\text{(2,R)}$ is done for a model for the water/vapor interface 
where a slab of 117 water molecules containing one \Li and one \nitrate is included 
in a period simulation box of size 15.60 \AA$\times$15.60 \AA$\times$31.00 \AA at 300 K.

%The keyword CUTOFF defines the plane wave cutoff (default unit is in Ry) for the finest level of the multi-grid. 
%The higher the plane wave cutoff, the finer the grid.
%Having constructed the multi-grid, QUICKSTEP then map the Gaussians onto the grids. The keyword REL$\_$CUTOFF controls which product Gaussians 
%are mapped onto which level of the multi-grid. CP2K tries to map each Gaussian onto a grid such that the number of grid points 
%covered by the Gaussian---no matter how wide or narrow---are roughly the same. REL$\_$CUTOFF defines the plane wave cutoff of a reference grid 
%covered by a Gaussian with unit standard deviation $e^{|{\bf r}|^2}$.\cite{CP2K}

%Therefore, the two most important keywords effecting the integration grid and the accuracy of a calculation are CUTOFF and REL$\_$CUTFF.
%If CUTOFF is too low, then all grids will be coarse and the calculation may become inaccurate; and if REL$\_$CUTOFF is too low, then even if one has a high CUTOFF, 
%all Gaussians will be mapped onto the coarsest level of the multi-grid, and thus the effective integration grid for the calculation may still be too coarse.

For the interface of the KNO$_3$ solution, the size of periodic box is $15.72 \times 15.72 \times 31.43$ \A$^3$. % KNO3
%For the interface of the NaNO$_3$ solution, the size of periodic box is $15.6530 \times 15.6530 \times 31.3060$ \A$^3$. % NaNO3, at T = 300 K

The simulated bulk alkali metal nitrate \LiN, NaNO$_3$, and KNO$_3$ solution consisted of one alkali metal ion, 
one nitrate ion and 127 water molecules in a periodic cubic box of length $L$, which corresponds to their density of $\sim$ 1.00 g cm$^{-3}$. 
Here, $L=15.78$, 15.65, and 15.72 for \LiN, NaNO$_3$, and KNO$_3$ solution, respectively.

%The simulated water-vapor interface consisted of 128 water molecules in a periodic box with size 15.64 $\times$ 15.64 $\times$ 31.28 \A$^3$.
%The simulated system consisted of 127 water molecules and a Li$^+$--NO$_3^-$ ion pair
%in a periodic cubic box of length $L=15.79$ \AA, which corresponds to a density of 0.997 g cm$^{-3}$. 

%In the model of the interface of \LiN solution, there is one \Li, one \nitrate and 127 water molecules in a periodic box of size 
%15.60 \AA$\times$15.60 \AA$\times$31.00 \A. 
\paragraph{Water/vapor interface}
To calculate the nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^\text{(2,R)}$ of the water/vapor interface, it is modeled with a slab 
made of 121 water molecules in a simulation box of size $15.60 \times 15.60 \times 31.00$ \A$^3$. 
DFTMD simulations for 300 and 330 K are run.

\paragraph{Interface of alkaline iodide solution}
$\chi^\text{(2,R)}$ is calculated for a model of the water/vapor interface where a slab of 118 
water molecules containing one \Li and one \I in a period simulation box of size 15.60 \AA $\times$ 15.60 \AA $\times$ 31.00 \AA.

%For LiI and NaI solutions, we use the following procedures to calculate the molar concentration of ions in the solutions we study:
%%&V_{\text{liquid}}=3.796\times10^{-33}\text{ m}^3 \nonumber
%$n_j=N_j\times[1/(6.02\times10^{23})] {\text{ mol}}$, and
%$V_{\text{liquid}}=15.6\times15.6\times15.6$ \A$^3$, 
%where $n_j$, $N_j$ and $V_{\text{liquid}}$ is the amount of substance $j$, the number of substance $j$, and the 
%volume of the liquid part of the aqueous/vapor interface.  
%For the water/vapor interface of LiI solution, 
%the simulation box is with the size of $15.6 \times 15.6 \times  31.0$ \A$^3$. 
%Half of the volume of the simulation box is vacuum. 
%In the liquid part of the simulation box, there are two \Li cations and two \I anions.
%Therefore, the molar concentration of the solution LiI is $c_{\text{LiI}}={n_{\text{LiI}}}/{V_\text{liquid}}=0.9\times10^3  \text{ mol}/\text{m}^3$.
%As an sample of our input files, we list the input file to run DFTMD, for the NaI solution.
