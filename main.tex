\begin{abstract}

I have analyzed the interfacial structure and dynamics of solutions containing alkali nitrates by Density Functional Theory-based 
Molecular Dynamics (DFTMD) simulations. In particular I have presented a detailed analysis of the Hydrogen Bond (HB) structure at the interface and 
have calculated the interface vibrational spectra in order to provide a molecular interpretation of available experimental data.
%
As a first system I have analyzed the behaviour of a salty water/vapor interface containing LiNO$_3$.
Both the measured and calculated Vibrational Sum-Frequency Generation (VSFG) spectra shows a reduced intensity of the lower frequency portion region,
when compared to the pure water/vapor interface.
This reduction is attributed to the H-bonds established between the \nitrate and the surrounding water molecules at the interface.
This effects is only related to the presence of \nitrate at the water surface and is not affected by the presence of alkali metal ions.
%I have shown that although the \Li can reside relative close to the water surface, also forming a water mediated
%ion pair with \nit, its effect on the VSFG spectrum is not visible. The water molecule which mediate the interaction
%between the \nitrate and the \Li would produce a red-shifted peak in small water cluster, but its influence is not visible
%neither in the VSFG spectra.
I have shown that the use of simple models, such as small cluster is not suitable to reproduce the experimental spectra 
and cannot provide a microscopic interpretation of the spectra.
Realistic models of the interface are required to address the perturbation of the ion on the water surface.
%
The difference between the HB dynamics outside the first shell of the \Li and that of nitrate-water Hydrogen (H-) bonds
at interfaces is not visible from the values of the HB relaxation time. They reflect the difference 
between HB dynamics in bulk water and that at the water/vapor interfaces.
For the water/vapor interface of alkaline iodine solutions, I find that the cations does not alter the H-bonding network outside the first hydration shell of cations.
It is concluded that no long-range structural-changing effects for alkali metal cations.
%
From the results of nonlinear susceptibilities, I conclude that these water molecules at the water/vapor interfaces of LiI, NaI, and KI solutions are participating
in weaker H-bonds, compared with those at the pure water surface.
The origin of the characteristics may come from a unique distribution of \I ions and alkali metal cations,
which form a double layer over the thickness on the order of 5--10 \A.
%
Finally, I obtain that faster rotational anisotropy decay exists for water molecules at the interface of aqueous alkali-iodine solutions, 
which is the result of a different HB types from the usual HB type in pure bulk water. 
This effect on anisotropy decay is due to the H--I bond at the interface.
This difference of HB structure from pure water/vapor interface changed the Im$\chi^{(2),\text{R}}$ spectrum
and the HB dynamics of the interface of alkali-iodine solution.
