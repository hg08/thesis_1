\chapter{Hydrogen Bond Dynamics of Water/Vapor Interfaces }\label{CHAPTER_HB}
%The influence of ions propensity for the aqueous surface on the water's HB network are also of special interest to the atmospheric chemistry community.
In this chapter, we explore the effects of nitrate ions, iodide ions and alkali metal cations 
on the HB dynamics at the water/vapor interface of alkali nitrate solutions and alkali
iodine solutions, by DFTMD 
and we provide a microscopic interpretation of recent experimental results. [\cite{HuaWei2014}]

\section{Definitions of Hydrogen Bond Population and Correlation Functions}
Luzar and Chandler [\cite{AL96}] have elucidated the HB dynamics of pure water, and
subsequently such analysis has been also extended to explore the HB dynamics
in complex situations, e.g., electrolytes, [\cite{AC00}] protein and  micellar surfaces. [\cite{SP05}]
There are temporal, geometric and energetic criteria to define HB. Here we use the geometric one.
Two water molecules are H-bonded only if their interoxygen distance between of specific tagged pair of water molecules 
is less than $r^{\text{c}}_{\text{OO}}=3.5$ \A, OH intermolecular distance less than $R^{\text{c}}_{\text{OH}}=2.45$ \AA and 
the O-H$\cdots$O angle is less than $\phi^{\text{c}}=\pi/6$. [\cite{AKS86,JT90,SB02}] 
The value 3.5 \AA corresponds to the first-minimum position of the O--O RDF of water. [\cite{Sciortino1989}]   
The distance criteria of $R_{\text{OH}}$  was determined from the first minimum in the O--H RDF for SPC water. [\cite{HJCB81}]

% introduce h(t)
The configuration criterion above allows us to define a dynamical variable $h[r(t)] = h(t)$, hydrogen bond population. 
The $h(t)$ has a value 1 when the particular tagged pair of molecules are bonded, and 0 otherwise. 
%=================
% added 2020-5-27: to show that h(t) is actually the fluctuation of itself (\delta h).
We know that the instantaneous fluctuation or deviation in a dynamical variable $A(t)$ from its time-independent equilibrium average $\langle A\rangle$ , 
is defined by [\cite{DC87}] 
$$
\delta A = A(t) - \langle A\rangle.
$$
For the $h(t)$, since the probability that a specific pair of molecules is bonded in a large system is extremely small, i.e., 
the time average of $h$ is zero, or  
$\langle h \rangle = 0$,
then 
$$
\delta h(t) = h(t).
$$
Therefore, the $h(t)$ describe the instantaneous fluctuation $\delta h(t)$  of hydrogen bond population.  
The behaviour of $h(t)$  is depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:Ex30ps_hb}. We find that in the equilibrium system, $h(t)$ looks chaotic.
%=================

While the equilibrium average of the $\delta h(t)$ is zero, but we can obtain some useful information by considering the equilibrium 
correlations between fluctuations at different times. The correlation between the $\delta h(t)$ and the $\delta h(0)$ can be written as 
$$
\langle \delta h(0) \delta h(t)\rangle = \langle h(0)h(t)\rangle-\langle h \rangle^2 = \langle h(0)h(t)\rangle,
$$
where the averaging $\langle\cdots\rangle$ is to be performed over the ensemble of initial conditions $(r^N, p^N)$.


In this section, we will use three correlation functions to describe the HB dynamics of water/vapor interfaces of solutions,
the HB population correlation function \CHB, the survival probability \SHB and the reactive flux $k(t)$. [\cite{DCR83}]

\paragraph{HB Population Auto-Correlation Function}
We use the correlation function \CHB to describe the structural relaxation of H-bonds: [\cite{Luzar1994,AL96,AC00}]
\begin{eqnarray}
C_{\text{HB}}(t)=\langle h(0)h(t) \rangle/\langle h\rangle
\label{eq:C_HB}.
\end{eqnarray}
With the aid of the ergodic principle, the ensemble average $\langle \cdots\rangle$ is implemented by time average.
The $\langle h\rangle$ is the probability that a pair of randomly chosen water molecules in the system is
H-bonded at any time $t$. As examples, the dynamics of the interoxygen distance $r_{\text{OO}}(t)$, 
the cosine of O$-$H$\cdots$O angle cos$\phi(t)$  
and the $h(t)$ for a HB in a water cluster is displayed in Fig.\space\ref{fig:Ex30ps_hb}, respectively.
%-------------------
\begin{figure}[hbtp]

\caption{\label{fig:Ex30ps_hb}The dynamics of $r_{\text{OO}}(t)$ (top), cos$\phi(t)$ (middle), 
  and $h(t)$ (bottom) for a HB in a water cluster. The dashed lines show the interoxygen distance 
  boundary $r^{\text{c}}_{\text{OO}}$=3.5 \AA (top) and criterion of cosine of O$-$H$\cdots$O angle cos$\phi^{\text{c}}$ 
  with $\phi^{\text{c}}$=$\pi/6$, respectively.}
\end{figure} 
%-------------------

The function \CHB is interpreted as the probability that the specific HB is intact at time  $t$, 
if it was intact at time zero. 
In a large system that consist of many water molecules, the probability that a specific pair of water molecules are H-bonded is extremely small. 
Therefore, the \CHB relaxes to zero, when $t$ is large enough. 
The \CHB measures correlation in $h(t)$ independent of any possible bond breaking events. 
It is one of the intermittent HB correlation functions, introduced by Rapaport, [\cite{DCR83}] 
and can be studied by a continuous function, probability densities.
From the \CHB, the HB relaxation time is computed as [\cite{Lee2007}]
\begin{eqnarray}
  \tau_{\text{R}} &=& \frac{\int t C_{\text{HB}}(t)\text{d}t}{\int C_{\text{HB}}(t)\text{d}t}.
\label{eq:tau_relaxation}
\end{eqnarray}

%
Because the thermal motion can cause distortions of H-bonds from the perfectly tetrahedral configuration,
water molecules show a librational motion on a time scale of $\sim$ 0.1 ps superimposed to rotational and diffusional motions ($\sim$ 1--10 ps), 
which causes a time variation of interaction parameters.
A new HB population $h^{(d)}(t)$ was also defined to obviate the distortion of real HB dynamics
due to the above geometric definition. [\cite{Sciortino1989,AC00}]
The $h^{(d)}(t)$ is 1 when the interoxygen distance of a particular tagged pair of water molecules is less than $r^{\text{c}}_{\text{OO}}=3.5$ \AA at time $t$ and 0 otherwise. 
The difference between the operators $h^{(d)}(t)$ and $h(t)$ is that those molecular pairs that meet the condition of $h^{(d)}(t)=1$ may not meet the condition of $h(t)=1$.
That is, the H-bonds between the tagged molecular pairs that satisfy the condition $h^{(d)}(t)=1$ may have been broken, but they may more easily form H-bonds again.
The function 
\begin{eqnarray}
  C^{(d)}_{\text{HB}}(t)=\langle h(0)h^{(d)}(t) \rangle/\langle h\rangle
\label{eq:C_HB_d}
\end{eqnarray}
is the probability that the specific two water molecules are located in reformable region ($r_{\text{OO}} < r^{\text{c}}_{\text{OO}}$) at time $t$,
if they were H-Bonded at time zero. 
The correlation function 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
n(t)=\langle h(0)[1-h(t)]h^{(d)}(t) \rangle/\langle h\rangle 
\label{eq:n_HB}
\end{eqnarray}
represents the probability at time $t$ 
that a tagged pair of initially H-bonded water molecules are unbonded but remain separated by less than $r_{\text{OO}}^{\text{c}}$.
In the above formula, $1-h(t)$ describes the breaking of a HB at time $t$ after its formation at time $t=0$.
%===============================
\paragraph{Survival Probability}
%\paragraph{Probability of the first HB Breaking}
%===============================
Another scheme to describe HB dynamics is the survival probability [\cite{AC00}] for a newly generated HB.
%The probability densities
It is defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{\text{HB}}(t)=\langle h(0)H(t) \rangle/\langle h\rangle 
\label{eq:S_HB},
\end{eqnarray}
where $H(t)=1$ if the tagged pair of molecules, remains \emph{continuously} H-bonded till time $t$ 
and 0 otherwise.  It describes the probability that an initially H-bonded molecular pair 
remains bonded at all times up to $t$. [\cite{Chowdhuri2006}]

The average continuum HB lifetime $\tau_{\text{HB}}$ is calculated by the integration of \SHB over $t$):  
\begin{eqnarray}
  \tau_{\text{HB}} &=& \int_0^\infty dt S_{\text{HB}}(t).
\label{eq:calculate_hb_lifetime}
\end{eqnarray}
%
The time derivative of \SHB
\begin{eqnarray}
P(t) &=& -\text{d}S_{\text{HB}}/\text{d}t
\label{eq:P_1}
\end{eqnarray}
is called probability distribution of HB lifetime in Ref.\cite{Sciortino1990prl,FWS99}. 
It also denotes the probability of the first HB breaking in time $t$ after it has been detected at $t=0$, i.e.,
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{\text{HB}}(t)= \int_t^\infty P(t')dt'.
\label{eq:P_2}
\end{eqnarray}
%
In terms of $h$, the probability distribution can be expressed as
\begin{eqnarray}
P(t) &=& \frac{\langle [1-h(0)]\delta [t-\int_0^t h(t')dt'][1-h(t)]\rangle}{\langle 1-h(0)\rangle},
\label{eq:P_3}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\langle \rangle$ denotes the average over all molecular pairs which are starting to H-bonded at time $t$.
%\paragraph{Average HB Lifetime $\tau_{\text{HB}}$} %\cite{HAK08}
%Like in water, librational motions of water molecules cause an rupturing and reforming of a H bond on a time scale of 60 fs.\cite{SHC86}

\paragraph{Probability Distribution of HB Lifetime in a Configuration}
Now we focus on a time $t$ in a system. Suppose there are $n$ H-bonds in the system at this moment, and we can distinguish a part of H-bonds from these H-bonds. 
The lifetime of this part of H-bonds is equal to a certain value $\tau$. We can assume that their number is $n_\tau$. 
Obviously, $n>n_\tau$. If we observe this part of H-bonds in the next time period $[t, t+\tau]$, then they will be broken once. 
That is to say, within $[t,t+\tau]$, we will detect the breaking of all H-bonds with lifetime $\tau$. 
Therefore, in a very short period of time $d\tau$, the probability of detecting these H-bonds is $(1/\tau)d\tau$.
Since the probability for the HB to have the lifetime $\tau$ is $P_t(\tau)$. Therefore, the relation between $P(t)$ and $P_t(t)$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
P(t) = \int_t^\infty P_t(\tau)\frac{d\tau}{\tau},
\label{eq:Pt_and_P}
\end{eqnarray}
i.e., the probability of the HB breaking for the first time in the time $t$ after detection at the initial moment depends on 
the number of those H-bonds whose lifetime exceeds the given time $t$. \cite{VPV09}

%\paragraph{Relation Between HB Dynamics and Anisotropy Decay}
%It is interesting to relate the HB kinetics with rotational dynamics (anisotropy decay) of single water molecules.\cite{HX01}
%
\paragraph{Reactive Flux $k(t)$} 
Calculating the reactive flux HB correlation functions and determine the rate constant ($1/\tau_{\text{HB}}$),
is a more rigorous way to obtain the nature of H-bonds at water/vapor interfaces. [\cite{AL00}]
The rate of relaxation to equilibrium is characterized by the reactive flux correlation function, 
\begin{eqnarray}
k(t) = -\text{d}C_{\text{HB}}/\text{d}t,
\label{eq:k}
\end{eqnarray}
i.e., $\langle j(0)[1-h(t)]\rangle/\langle h\rangle$,
where 
$j(0)=-\text{d}h/\text{d}t|_{t=0}$ 
is the integrated flux departing the HB configuration space at time $t=0$.
The reactive flux $k(t)$ quantifies the rate that an initially present HB breaks at time $t$, 
independent of possible breaking and reforming events in the interval from 0 to $t$.
Therefore, the $k(t)$ measures the effective decay rate of an 
initial set of H-bonds. [\cite{DC87,FWS00}]

For bulk neat water, there exists a $\sim 0.2$-ps transient period,
during which the $k(t)$ quickly changes from its initial value. [\cite{FWS00}]
However, at longer times, the $k(t)$ is independent of the HB definitions.
Therefore, the long time decay reflects the general properties of H-bonds (in water solutions).
We assume that each HB acts independently of other H-bonds, [\cite{AL96,AL00}] 
and due to detailed balance condition, we can obtain 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \tau_{\text{HB}} &=& \frac{1- \langle h\rangle}{k},
\label{eq:rate}
\end{eqnarray}
where $k$ is the rate constant of breaking an H bond (forward rate constant). [\cite{Chandler1986,Chandler1978}] 
For an aqueous interface, the probability of exactly a tagged molecule pair forming a HB is very low, that is, $\langle h\rangle << 1$. Therefore,
the $k$ is related to the average HB lifetime by $\tau_{\text{HB}}=1/k$.
We use $k'$ to represent the backward rate constant, that is, the rate constant from the HB \emph{on} state to the HB \emph{off} state for a tagged pair of molecules.
Therefore, the reaction time constant $\tau$ is 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \tau &=& \frac{1}{k+k'}.
\label{eq:reaction_rate_tau}
\end{eqnarray}

% This paragraph is just an approximation:
%For dynamical trajectories which are longer than the initial time decay ($t > t_{\text{trans}}\sim 0.2$ ps),
%we have
%\begin{eqnarray}
%k(t)&=&\langle j(0)[1-h(t)]\rangle/\langle h\rangle \sim ke^{-k t}.
%\label{eq:k_2}
%\end{eqnarray}

%\paragraph{Mean First Passage Time Probability Densities}
%From Fig.\space\ref{fig:124_2NaI_hbacf_testing}, we can see that the calculation of \SHB converges very well in the time scale of 5 ps.

\section{Environment Effects on Hydrogen Bond Dynamics}
For the water/vapor interface of neat water, we focus on the reactive flux $k(t)$, 
which had been used in the study of HB dynamics of liquid water. [\cite{AL96,Khaliullin2013}]
The $k(t)$ calculated from the positional trajectory of water molecules in DFTMD simulations, is reported in Fig.\space\ref{fig:121}. 
In the case of water/vapor interface, the $k(t)$ quickly changes from its initial value on a time scale of less than 0.2 ps 
(see the inset of Fig.\space\ref{fig:121}). 
Beyond this transient period, the $k(t)$ decays to zero monotonically, and the slop of the $\ln{k(t)}$ increases monotonically with $t$ (see Fig.\space\ref{fig:121_log_rf}). 
These two properties were also found for bulk water using the SPC water model by Luzar and Chandler. [\cite{AL96}] 
This log-log plot of the $k(t)$ shows that, as in the case of liquid water, this decay behaviour does not coincide with a power-law decay for water/vapor interface of neat water.
This result is also the same as that of the classical molecular simulation of pure water. [\cite{AL96b,Luzar1996}]

%

We focus on the value of the $k(t)$ when $t$ is sufficiently large ($t \in [1, 10]$ ps). 
The $k(t)$ in Fig. \ref{fig:hbrf_4pl} are calculated by the interface 
under the same condition. The difference is that Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:hbrf_4pl} (a) is the result of the interface of pure water,
and Fig. \ref{fig:hbrf_4pl} (b), (c) and (d) are the result of the interface of the LiI, NaI and KI solutions, respectively.

\end{table}
%
%For the water/vapor interface of alkali-iodine solutions, the $k(t)$ is also calculated.  The result for the interface of 0.9 M LiI solution is shown in Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:hbrf_4pl} (b). The log-log plot of $k(t)$ is not a straight line, indicating that, for water/vapor interface of the LiI solution, this decay does not coincide with a power-law decay, neither.


As can be seen from Fig. \ref{fig:hbrf_4pl}, the fluctuations of the $k (t)$ for $d = 2$ \AA (blue solid line) are significantly larger 
than that of other cases with larger $d$. 
This phenomenon is due to the relatively small number of water molecules in the thin layer 
and the insufficient sampling, resulting in large fluctuations in $k(t)$.
For these four models, as the thickness $d$ of the interface increases, the $k(t)$ gradually converges to a function with smaller fluctuations.
%
This conclusion is consistent with the two conclusions we obtained earlier (see Section \ref{sfg_alkali_iodide_interface}): 
(1) \I is a strong structure-breaking anion; %[\cite{Trevani2000}] 
(2) compared to pure water, the OH stretching peak at the interface of a solution containing iodide ions will blue shift. [\cite{Tongraar2010}] 
Comparing these black solid curves, we can see that the interface of the solution containing ions has lower $k(t)$.
In other words, compared to the pure water interface, 
the ratio of H-bonds that were initially bonded at the solution interface and broken at time $t$ is lower.
Because the effect of iodide ions is to increase the $k(t)$ of the interface, the decrease of $k (t)$ of the interface with a larger thickness
may only be due to the contribution of cations located under the first layer of water molecules at the interface. 
Therefore, although the iodide ion increases the HB rupture rate at the top layer of the interface, 
in general, the HB rupture rate of the entire solution interface is reduced due to the presence of cations under the first layer of water molecules. 
To verify this conclusion, we calculated the $k(t)$ at the interface of NaI (Fig. \ref{fig:hbrf_4pl} (c)) and KI (Fig. \ref{fig:hbrf_4pl} (d)) aqueous solution. 
The results for both interface systems support our conclusions above.

What is the differences between bulk and interface? 
Let us examine the difference in the $k(t)$ between interface water and bulk water. 
No matter from pure water (Fig. \ref{fig:hbrf_4pl} (a)) 
or solution (Fig. \ref{fig:hbrf_4pl} (b), (c) or (d)), we find that when the interface thickness is thin, the fluctuation of $k(t)$ is larger.
Because the thinner the interface, the fewer pairs of water molecules that can form hydrogen bonds. 
In our calculations, the fewer samples are used to average, so the fluctuation of $k (t)$ is greater. 
We can find that at the interface of pure water, when $t> 0.2$ ps, the $k(t)$ value of the interface with different thickness is almost equal 
at any time period $\Delta t$. For example, $\Delta t$ is selected as $\sim$ 2 ps, 
and its average value is shown in Table \ref{tab:hbrf_neat}. In each time period of 2 ps, the values of $k(t)$ for different layers are approximately equal
($\pm 0.004$ ps$^{-1}$). Therefore, as far as the nature of HB reactive flux is concerned, the difference between interface and bulk phase of neat water is not obvious. 


In order to show the effect of water molecule diffusion on the HB dynamics, we can calculate the sum of the functions $c(t)$ and $n(t)$, i.e., $c(t)+n(t)$.
%Here, we take the LiI solution as an example.
Fig.\space\ref{fig:124_2LiI_ns20_c_plus_n} shows the time dependence of the correlation functions $c(t)$, $n(t)$ and $c(t)+n(t)$ of the interface of 
the LiI solution at a concentration of 0.9 M in the AIMD simulation.
As can be seen, although the change in the total population, $c(t)+n(t)$, is very small in the range of 0--10 ps, it is not a constant.
Therefore, the $n(t)$ relaxes not only by conversion back to HB \emph{on} state, 
but is also depleted due to the diffusion process. We can estimate the time scale of water molecule diffusion at the interface of the aqueous solution by $c(t)+n(t) = 1/e$, 
which is much larger than 10 ps. Therefore, when we analyze the HB dynamics of the solution interfaces, we do not consider the effect of water molecule diffusion.

Khaliullin and K\"uhne have studied the H-bonding kinetics of pure water using AIMD simulations. [\cite{Khaliullin2013}]
Based on the concepts of $h(t)$, $h^{(d)}(t)$, $n(t)$ and $k(t)$, they have used the simulation data 
obtained by the AIMD simulation method to obtain the ratio $k/k'$ in the bulk water, and then the lifetime and relaxation time 
of the HB.  Here, we also use the AIMD simulation method to study the HB dynamics at the interface of LiI, NaI, and KI aqueous 
solutions. We use the least squares fitting method to obtain the optimal solution range of $k$ and $k'$ from the relationship 
between the reactive flux and the HB population correlation function $c(t)$ and $n(t)$, and the parameters $k$ and $k'$, i.e.,
\begin{eqnarray}
  k(t) = kc(t)-k'n(t).
\label{eq:fitting_k_rates}
\end{eqnarray}
%
%[Answer Q3]
We can find the optimal value of the parameters, $k$ and $k'$, 
by minimizing the function $\Delta(k,k') = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \big|\ln[kc(t)-k'n(t)] - \ln[k(t)]\big|dt$. 
In order to study the HB dynamics after the transition phase, which is roughly at 0.1 ps (see Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:121}) and lasts for hundreds of picoseconds, 
we set $t_1 = 1$ ps and $t_2 = 10$ ps in the fitting.
For water/vpaor interfaces of neat water and the aqueous solution interfaces, the fitting results we obtained are plotted in 
Fig.\thinspace\ref{fig:121_pure_ns20_fit_map}--\ref{fig:124_2KI_ns20_fit_map}, 
and the optimal values of $k$ and $k'$ given by these results have been listed in Table \ref{tab:k_k_prime_pure_and_solutions}. 
These values are comparable in magnitude to those obtained by Ref.\thinspace[{\cite{Khaliullin2013}}]

It can be seen from Table \ref{tab:k_k_prime_pure_and_solutions} that the HB breaking reaction rate ($k$) at the interface of pure water is basically equivalent to 
that at the solution interface, but the HB reforming rate ($k'$) is smaller than that at the solution interface by 30\% to 50\%.
Correspondingly, we can find the HB relaxation times of the three solution interfaces are: $\tau=\frac{1}{k+k'} \sim $2.0--2.5 ps. 
For pure water interface, the relaxation time is $\tau \sim $ 3.3 ps. 
Our conclusion is that the difference between the relaxation time of H-bonds at the interface of solutions such as LiI, NaI, KI 
and the interface of pure water is mainly due to the difference in the reforming rate $k'$ of H-bonds caused by the presence of ions,
rather than the difference in the breaking rate $k$ of H-bonds.

As for the effect of water/vapor interface on the HB dynamics in alkali-iodine solutions,
we also calculate the survival probability for interfaces with different sizes of thickness. 
The result for the interface of the LiI solution exhibits that H-bonds at water/vapor 
interface decay faster than that in bulk water.
The result for the logarithm of \SHB is displayed in Fig.\space\ref{fig:2LiI-124w_S_layers} in Appendix \ref{thickness_interface}, 
in which the thickness of the alkali-iodine solutions can be determined.
Therefore, as the interface thickness increases, the \SHB converges to a curve, 
which characterizes the HB dynamics of bulk solutions. 
In particular, it gives the average continuum HB lifetime in bulk solutions.

\paragraph{Effects of the Ions Concentration}
Effects of ions' concentration on HB dynamics have been studied extensively by Chandra. [\cite{AC00}]
%Pal and coworkers provided details on the structure of water around the micellar surface.\cite{SP05} 
We calculated the \CHB for the water/vapor interfaces of the alkali-iodine solutions, 
and the relaxation time $\tau_{\text{R}}$ for each of them can be determined. 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%    C_{\text{HB}}(\tau_\text{{R}})=1/e. \nonumber
%\label{eq:relaxation_time}
%\end{eqnarray}
Here, the \emph{interface} means \emph{all} the water molecules in each model. 
The $\tau_{\text{R}}$ for the water/vapor interfaces of the LiI (NaI) solutions are displayed in 
Table \ref{tab:tau_hb}. Generally, they are in the range 1--10 ps. 
The values of $\tau_{\text{R}}$ decrease as the concentration of the solutions increases.
\begin{table}[htbp]

  0.9 M & 7.04 & 10.60 \\
  1.8 M & 4.40 & 1.96 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The concentration dependence of the HB dynamics can be also found in the \SHB. 
Fig.\space\ref{fig:124_2LiI-2NaI_hbacf_S}(a) gives the \SHB 
for the water/vapor interfaces of 0.9 M and 1.8 M LiI solutions.
The same quantity for NaI solutions is displayed in Fig.\space\ref{fig:124_2LiI-2NaI_hbacf_S}(b).
This result indicates that, for the interface of alkali-iodine solution, the continuum HB lifetime  
decrease as the concentration of LiI (or NaI) solution increase.

As shown in Fig.\space\ref{fig:vdos_LiNO3-256w_w_near_nitrate} in chapter ~\ref{CHAPTER_SFG_Calculation}, 
from the VDOS, the water molecules bound to \nitrate have higher OH stretching frequency (55 cm$^{-1}$ larger) 
than those H-bonded to other water molecules. 
%
Now, the difference between nitrate--water and water--water H-bonds 
can be also analyzed in terms of the survival probability $S_{\text{HB}}(t)$, [\cite{AKS86,JT90,AL96}] 
reported in Fig.\thinspace\ref {fig:256_LiNO3_hbacf_sh_no3}.
The integration of \SHB from 0 to $t_{\max}=5.0$ ps, [\cite{Steinel2004}] gives the relaxation time $\tau_\text{HB}$, which can be interpreted as 
the average HB lifetime. [\cite{SC02}] 
The values of $\tau_{\text{HB}}$ is dependent on a temporal resolution $t_t$, during which the H-bonds that break and reform are treated as intact. [\cite{AL00}] 
%
Here, we choose the temporal resolution as $t_t=1$ fs. 
Then, Fig.\thinspace\ref {fig:256_LiNO3_hbacf_sh_no3} gives $\tau_\text{HB}=0.20$ ps for nitrate--water H-bonds at interfaces, and $\tau_\text{HB}=0.42$ ps for water--water H-bonds.
This result of $\tau_\text{HB}$ is consistent with the experimental result of Kropman and Bakker ($\tau_\text{HB}=0.5\pm0.2$ ps). [\cite{MFK01}]
The smaller value of $\tau_\text{HB}$ for nitrate--water H-bonds implies that the nitrate--water H-bonds are weaker than bonds between water molecules. 
This is also consistent with the VDOS analysis and the blue-shifted frequency of the OH stretching in the nitrate-water HB. 
%[DELETED From both the VDOS and HB dynamics calculations, we conclude that it is the weak HBs between nitrate and water make the higher surface propensity 
%of nitrate anions, and then induce the depletion of SFG intensity at 3200 \cm for the alkali nitrate salty interfaces.]

%Fig. ~\ref{fig:256_LiNO3_hbacf_Nitrate_effect} shows that the nitrate ions accelerate the HB dynamics at the vapor/water interface of alkali nitrate solution.

%Fecko and co-workers' study of liquid D$_2$O by IR spectroscopy reveals that the vibrational dynamics observed are dominated by underdamped displacement of the hydrogen-bond coordinate at very short times ( less than 200 fs).\cite{CJF03,CJF05} 
Fig.\space\ref{fig:hbacf_C_sh2_2p} (a) and (b) show that the \CHB of H-bonds within the alkali cations and \I decay faster than those in bulk water and at the surface of LiI solution.

%The simulation produces similar result as Omta and coworker's experiments of femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy, which demonstrate that anions ( $\text{SO}^{2-}_4$, $\text{ClO}^-_4$, etc) have no influence on the dynamics of bulk water, even at high concentration up to 6 M.\cite{AWO03}

\section{Rotational Anisotropy Decay of Water at the Interface of Alkali-Iodine Solutions}\label{CHAPETR_AD}
Using the transition dipole auto-correlation function, 
we determined the rotational anisotropy decay and therefore the OH-stretch relaxation at water/vapor interface of alkali iodide solutions.
%The effects of ion environment on structure and dynamics of water are obtained by comparing the second-order Legendre polynomial, i.e.,  $P_2(x)=\frac{1}{2}(3x^2-1)$,  orientational correlation function of the transition dipole.
The anisotropy decay can be determined from experimental signal in two different polarization configurations---parallel and perpendicular polarizations, by 
\begin{equation}
        R(t)=\frac{S_{\parallel}(t)-S_{\perp}(t)}{S_{\parallel}(t)+2S_{\perp}(t)}
\label{eq:ad}
\end{equation}
where $t$ is the time between pump and probe laser pulses.  The anisotropy decay can also be obtained by simulations, and calculated by the third-order response functions $R(t)$. [\cite{Jansen10,Jansen06}]
%
%In the first shell with a radius 3 \A, the entropy difference betweem the \Li shell and \Na shell,
%$\Delta S=k_B\text{ln}\frac{\Omega_\text{Na}}{\Omega_\text{Li}}=k_B\text{ln}\frac{n_\text{Na}/V_\text{Na}}{n_\text{Li}/V_\text{Li}} =k_B\text{ln}1.05$.
%
%\paragraph{Probability Distribution of Ions}
%The probability distribution, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig: prob_124_LiI_Sans_double_axis}, of the ions in the water/vapor interface of LiI and NaI solutions with repect to the depth of the ions in the solutions 
%indicates that the \I ions prefer to staying at the topmost layer of surface of solutions.
%(molar concentration: 0.9 M, temperature: 330 K) 
%It shows that \I ions tend to the surface of the solutions, while \Na and \Li tend to stay in the bulk. This result is consistent with the calculations from Ishiyama and Morita\cite{TI07,TI14}.
The orientational anisotropy $C_2(t)$ is given by the rotational time-correlation function 
\begin{equation}
C_2(t)=\langle P_2(\hat{u}(0)\cdot\hat{u}(t)) \rangle,
\label{eq:tcf2}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{u}(t)$ is the time dependent unit vector of the transition dipole, $P_2(x)$ is the second Legendre polynomial, and $\langle \rangle$ indicate 
equilibrium ensemble average. [\cite{Corcelli05,LinYS2010}] %\cite{2010Lin} % angular brackets

The anisotropy decay $C_2(t)$ for the water/vapor interface of LiI solution is shown in Fig.\space\ref{fig:c2_2LiI_16_inset}.
This function decays faster than that of neat water, indicating that H-bonds
at the interfaces of alkali-iodine solutions reorient faster than in neat water. The inset shows the first 0.4 ps of $C_2(t)$, from which we see a 
quick change during the first $\sim 0.1$ ps primarily due to librations.

We also calculated the $C_2(t)$ for the interface of other alkali-iodine solutions LiI and KI. 
The results of $C_2(t)$ for the water/vapor interfaces of these solutions are shown in Fig.\space\ref{fig:c2_2KI_2NaI_2LiI_16}.
In all the cases $C_2(t)$ decays faster than in neat water, indicating that H-bonds
at the interfaces of the three alkali-iodine solutions are orientated faster than that of neat water.
They show that \I ions can accelerate the dynamics of molecular reorientation of water molecules at interfaces.

We have obtained non-single-exponential kinetics for the rotation of water molecules both at the surface 
and in bulk water (Appendix \ref{single_exp}).
%This result is true for water molecules bound to ions. 
Therefore, the rotational motion of water molecules are not simply characterized by well-defined rate constants. 
%Then the problem is to understand the kinetics.
Similar non-single-exponential kinetics is also obtained in the HB kinetics
in liquid water [\cite{AL96,Dirama05}] and in the time variation of the average frequency shifts of the 
remaining modes after excitation in hole burning technique [\cite{Rey2002,Moller2004}] and using BLYP functional. [\cite{Bankura2014}]
Luzar and Chandler interpreted 
the non-single-exponential kinetics as the result of an interplay between 
diffusion and HB dynamics. [\cite{AL96}] 
We can understand the non-single-exponential kinetics of rotational 
anisotropy decay by fitting the rotational anisotropy decay by a 
biexponential function.

To obtain the effects of diffusion and HB decay of water molecules
in solutions respectively, we assume that there are two independent 
decays in the process of an anisotropy decay. 
Therefore, the $C_2(t)$ has the form [\cite{TanHS05}]
\begin{equation}
C_2(t)=A_1e^{-\kappa_1 t} +A_2e^{-\kappa_2 t},
\label{eq:tcf3}
\end{equation}
where $A_i$ are constants and $\kappa_i$ are decay rates ($i=1, 2$). 
The time constants and amplitudes of the biexponentials fits for 
the $C_2(t)$ are listed in Table ~\ref{tab:2LiI_c2_biexp} and Table ~\ref{tab:2NaI_c2_biexp}.
The biexponential fit is very close to the calculated $C_2(t)$, which can be seen in Fig.\space\ref{fig:2LiI-124w_c2_fit_5ps_biexp} (compare Fig.\space\ref{fig:2LiI-124w_c2_fit_5_single-exp}).

Then we considered the effect of ion species in solutions on the anisotropy decay of water molecules.
From Table \ref{tab:2LiI_c2_biexp} and Table \ref{tab:2NaI_c2_biexp}, we find that 
for both LiI and NaI solutions, there are two decay processes in the dynamics --- amplitude $\sim 1$,
decay constant $\sim$ 0.1 THz, and for the other describe the initial fast decay 
of the anisotropy, with amplitude $\sim 0.1$, decay constant $\sim$ (1--10) THz, 
due to the inertial-librational motion preceding the orientational diffusion.
That is, two decay processes exist in the dynamics of water molecules 
at the water/vapor interfaces of alkali-iodine solutions. 
%The one describe the initial fast decay of the anisotropy, 
%with amplitude $\sim$ 0.1, decay constant $\sim$ (1--10) THz,

\paragraph{Classification of Water Molecules Based on H-Bonds}
We also studied the relation between the anisotropy decay of water molecules and their environment. 
Following the definition used in Ref.[\cite{TianCS08}], we use the following labels to denote water molecules in solution: 
$D$ denotes that the water molecule donates a HB, $D'$ donates that the water donates a H-I bond, and $A$ donates that the water accepts a HB. %\cite{2008NJ} 
$DDAA$ represents a water molecule with two H-Bonds donated to water molecules and two H-Bonds accepted from water molecules (see Fig.\space\ref{fig:Multiple_figs}(a));
$DD'AA$ represents a water molecule with two HBs donated to a water molecule and \I, and with two H-Bonds accepted from other water molecules (see Fig.\space\ref{fig:Multiple_figs}(c)), 
$D'AA$ represents a water molecule bonded to \I at the water/vapor interface and other H-Bonds to water molecules (see Fig.\space\ref{fig:Multiple_figs}(d)).
Clearly, we can see that $D'AA$ molecules are of free OH stretching during the dynamics. All four types of water molecules are displayed in Fig.\space\ref{fig:Multiple_figs}.

It is evident, from our calculations (Fig.\space\ref{fig:2LiI-124w_c2_fit_biexp_7wat_2ps_class_150324}), that the $C_2(t)$ for $DDAA$ and $DD'AA$ molecules do not decay exponentially (Table \ref{tab:fitting_c2_for_each_type_of_water}).
%[BUT Table \ref{tab:fitting_c2_for_each_type_of_water} CAN NOT GIVE THE EVIDENCE. STH. IS MISSING!] 
This result is similar to the reactive flux HB correlation function $k(t)$, i.e., 
the escaping rate kinetics of H-bonds in bulk water. [\cite{Luzar1996}] 
The relaxation of H-bonds in water appears complicated, with no simple characterization in terms of a few relaxation rate constants. 
Most of the authors believe that the cooperativity between neighbouring H-bonds, [\cite{Sciortino1989, Ohmine1995}] or 
self evident coupling between translational diffusion and HB dynamics is the source of the complexity. [\cite{Luzar1996}] 
However, for $D'AA$ molecules at the interface of the LiI solution,
the $C_2(t)$ decays exponentially, i.e.
\begin{eqnarray}
  C_2(t) &=& C e^{-{\kappa}t},
\label{eq:C_2_D_prime_AA}
\end{eqnarray}
where the amplitude is $C=0.76$, and the reorientation rate is $\kappa = 0.99$ ps$^{-1}$.
The single exponential decay of $C_2(t)$ for $D'AA$ molecules, indicates that each $D'AA$  molecule reorientate independently to each other. 

Furthermore, the $C_2(t)$ for $D'AA$ molecules decays much faster than that for $DDAA$ or $DD'AA$ molecules.
From the definitions, the $D'AA$ water molecule owns only three H-bonds, while both $DDAA$ and $DD'AA$ water molecules own four H-bonds.
Therefore, the correlation between H-bonds around the $D'AA$ molecule is weaker than those around the $DDAA$ or $DD'AA$ molecule. 
Faster decay of $C_2(t)$ for $D'AA$ molecules shows that the reorientation process of $D'AA$
molecules is much smaller than those water molecules in bulk phase, e.g., the $DDAA$, and $DD'AA$ molecules.

Finally, for $D'AA$ molecules, the inertial-librational motion can not be seen (Fig.\space\ref{fig:2LiI-124w_c2_fit_biexp_7wat_2ps_class_150324}). 
This result implies that the rotational anisotropy decay of $D'AA$ molecules
are of the same time scale of the inertial libration, i.e., $\sim$ 0.2 ps.

Rotational anisotropy decay of water molecules is found at the interface of LiI solution. 
The result comes from a different HB types from the usual $DDAA$ HB type in pure bulk water.
The faster anisotropy decay for $D'AA$ molecules reflects the less correlation between different H-bonds for $D'AA$ molecules, which comes from Hydrogen--Iodide bond at the interfaces, the existence of free OH stretching.
From Fig.\space\ref{fig:prob_124_LiI_double_axis}, we have known that in the LiI solution, 
\I ions prefer to locate at the water/vapor interface.  
Therefore, we infer that the reduction of the inter-correlations between H-bonds occurs at the water/vapor interfaces. 

%
In conclusion, single exponential type rotational anisotropy decay exists for water molecules at the water/vapor interface of the alkali-iodine solutions,
and this faster anisotropy decay of water molecules at the water/vapor interface is the effects of Hydrogen--Iodide (H--I) bond at the interface. 
Since the iodide's surface propensity is high, this difference of HB structure 
from neat water/vapor interface is the source of 
the HB dynamics as well as the Im$\chi^{(2)}$ spectrum of the interface of alkali-iodine solutions.

%\subsection{\LiN Solution/vapor Interface}
%The anisotropy decay of OH bonds in water molecules in 0.4 M LiNO3 solution/vapor interface is shown in Fig.\space\ref{fig:c2_LiNO3_inset}.  In the model of the interface, there is one \Li and one \nitrate in the 15.6 \AA$\times$15.6 \AA$\times$31.0 \AA simulation box. 
%The larger decay rate consistent to the conclusion infered from the VDOS for the interfaces, although the concentration of \LiN is lower. This result obtained from another DFTMD trajectory consistent with the previous one, and it reflects that the \nitrate on the surface of the alkali nitrate solution weaken the H-bonds and  accelerate the anisotropy decay of water molecules at the interfaces.
