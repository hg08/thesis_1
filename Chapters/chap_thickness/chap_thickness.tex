\chapter{Thickness of the Interface of the Aqueous Solutions} \label{thickness_interface}
To determine the thickness of the water/vapor interface of alkali solutions,
we chose several different thickness values of slab of the interface and calculate 
the corresponding susceptibility for these slabs, respectively.
Take the water/vapor interface of LiNO$_3$ solution as an example. We chose seven different thickness 
values---from 2 to 8 \A, and calculate VSFG intensities $I_{SSP} \propto |\chi^{(2),\text{R}}_{SSP}|^2$ 
for the water/vapor interface with a thickness of each of these values. 
The result is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:117_2LiNO3_30ps_2-6A_150_Im_150720} (a) and (b).
It shows that $|\chi^{(2),\text{R}}_{SSP}|^2$ converges as the thickness increases to 8 \A.

 in a period simulation box of 15.6 \AA$\times$15.6 \AA$\times$31.0 \AA at 300 K.}

%As the limitation of the box scale, we chose 4 different thickness values---$d=2,3,4,5$ \A, for checking. The VSFG intensities $I_{SSP} \propto |\chi^{(2),R}_{SSP}|^2$ for the water/vapor interface of the LiI solution are given in Fig.~\ref{fig:124_2LiI_30ps_2-5A_150_Im_150720} (a) and (b). The results show that $|\chi^{(2),R}_{SSP}|^2$ increases as the thickness increase from 2 \AA to 5 \A.

The thickness of the water/vapor interface of solutions can also be seen from the calculated RDF. 
For example, the RDFs of interface of the NaI solution is shown in Fig.\space\ref{fig:2NaI-124w_gdr_OH_s2_150122}.
It indicates that the thickness of the water/vapor interface is about 8 \A.

Furthermore, we also estimated the thickness of a water/vapor interface by calculating the HB dynamics for it. 
Fig.\space\ref{fig:2LiI-124w_S_layers} shows the dependence of the logarithm of survival probability on the thickness of the water/vapor interface 
of the LiI solution. We see that when $d = 8$ \AA the $\ln S_{\text{HB}}$ of the interface 
does not change as the thickness increases, indicating the thickness of the interface.
