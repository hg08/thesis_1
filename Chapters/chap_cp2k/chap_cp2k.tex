\chapter{Computational Details of the DFTMD Simulations}\label{computational_detail}
In the thesis, the DFT calculations were done with the CP2K program, which incorporates the Gaussian and Plane Waves (GPW) method\cite{GL99}. 
Core electrons were described by Goedecker-Teter-Hutter pseudopotentials\cite{MK05}, while the valence electrons were expanded as a double-zeta Gaussian basis set.
%The keyword CUTOFF defines the plane wave cutoff (default unit is in Ry) for the finest level of the multi-grid. 
%The higher the plane wave cutoff, the finer the grid.
%Having constructed the multi-grid, QUICKSTEP then map the Gaussians onto the grids. The keyword REL$\_$CUTOFF controls which product Gaussians 
%are mapped onto which level of the multi-grid. CP2K tries to map each Gaussian onto a grid such that the number of grid points 
%covered by the Gaussian---no matter how wide or narrow---are roughly the same. REL$\_$CUTOFF defines the plane wave cutoff of a reference grid 
%covered by a Gaussian with unit standard deviation $e^{|{\bf r}|^2}$.\cite{CP2K}

%Therefore, the two most important keywords effecting the integration grid and the accuracy of a calculation are CUTOFF and REL$\_$CUTFF.
%If CUTOFF is too low, then all grids will be coarse and the calculation may become inaccurate; and if REL$\_$CUTOFF is too low, then even if one has a high CUTOFF, 
%all Gaussians will be mapped onto the coarsest level of the multi-grid, and thus the effective integration grid for the calculation may still be too coarse.

In the following paragraphs, the input files for the water/vapor interfaces of neat water and NaI solution, respectively.

\section{Input File for Neat Water/Vapor Interface}
The CP2K input file to run DFTMD, for the system of water/vapor interface, is as follows.

\section{Input File for the Interface of Alkali-Iodine Solution}
For LiI and NaI solutions, we use the following procedures to calculate the molar concentration of ions in the solutions we study:
%&V_{\text{liquid}}=3.796\times10^{-33}\text{ m}^3 \nonumber
$n_j=N_j\times[1/(6.02\times10^{23})] {\text{ mol}}$, and
$V_{\text{liquid}}=15.6\times15.6\times15.6$ \A$^3$, 
where $n_j$, $N_j$ and $V_{\text{liquid}}$ is the amount of substance $j$, the number of substance $j$, and the 
volume of the liquid part of the aqueous/vapor interface.  
For the water/vapor interface of LiI solution, 
the simulation box is with the size of $15.6 \times 15.6 \times  31.0$ \A$^3$. 
Half of the volume of the simulation box is vacuum. 
In the liquid part of the simulation box, there are two \Li cations and two \I anions.
Therefore, the molar concentration of the solution LiI is $c_{\text{LiI}}={n_{\text{LiI}}}/{V_\text{liquid}}=0.9\times10^3  \text{ mol}/\text{m}^3$.
As an sample of our input files, we list the input file to run DFTMD, for the NaI solution.
