The corresponding generalized Kohn-Sham eigenvalue gaps are shown to incorporate part of the discontinuity (Formula presented) of the exchange-correlation potential of standard Kohn-Sham theory. As an example, a generalized Kohn-Sham procedure splitting the exchange contribution to the total energy into a screened, nonlocal and a local density component is considered. This method leads to band gaps far better than those of local-density approximation and to good structural properties for the materials Si, Ge, GaAs, InP, and InSb. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

abstract  ="We discuss the role of the presence of dangling H-bonds from water or from surface hydroxyl species on the wetting behavior of surfaces. Using scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopies and photoelectron spectroscopy{,} we have examined a variety of surfaces{,} including mica{,} oxides and pure metals. We find that in all cases{,} the availability of free{,} dangling H-bonds at the surface is crucial for the subsequent growth of wetting water films. In the case of mica{,} electrostatic forces and H-bonding to surface O atoms determine the water orientation in the first layer and also in subsequent layers with a strong influence in its wetting characteristics. In the case of oxides like TiO2{,} Cu2O{,} SiO2 and Al2O3{,} surface hydroxyls form readily on defects upon exposure to water vapor and help nucleate the subsequent growth of molecular water films. On pure metals{,} such as Pt{,} Pd and Ru{,} the structure of the first water layer and whether or not it exhibits dangling H-bonds is again crucial. Dangling H-bonds are provided by molecules with their plane oriented vertically{,} or by OH groups formed by the partial dissociation of water. By tying the two H atoms of the water molecules into strong H-bonds with pre-adsorbed O on Ru can also quench the wettability of the surface."

    title = {{For the chosen time step and number of steps, the frequency range we can obtain for the VDOS is (3, 3.3$\times10^4$)cm$^{-1}$  (from the Nyquist criterion). 
It is reasonable to analyze vibrations of water molecules whose frequencies are in (1600, 3800)cm$^{-1}$.
To obtain the vibrations with the highest frequecies $\nu_\text{max}$, the sampling rates $f_{s}$ must be at least as high as $f_s=2\nu_\text{max}$, thus, the time step $\Delta{t}$ must satisfy $\Delta{t}\leq{1}/{2\nu_\text{max}}$.
   If $f_{s}$ is known, the upper bound of vibrational frequencies $\nu_\text{max}$ can be calculated.
   For a sequence with $M$ steps, the maximun period $T_\text{max}=\Delta{t}$ (the maximum frequency ${f_s}_\text{max}=1/{\Delta{t}}$).
   $f_{s_\text{max}}=2\nu_\text{max}$, then $\nu_\text{max}={f_s}_\text{max}/{2}=1/{2\Delta{t}}$.
   In our simulation, the time step is 0.5 fs and the total number of steps $M\approx10^4$. Thus the frequency range of the VDOS is in $(3.3, 3.3\times 10^4)$ cm$^{-1}$.
   In this thesis, we consider the vibrational modes of water molecules in (1600, 3800) cm$^{-1}$.
   The time step is 0.5 fs.}}

Global emissions, both natural and man-made, of sulphur and nitrogen oxides are discussed and examples of spatial distributions and trends over the last century presented. The more significant chemical and physical processes involved in the transformation of the primary emissions into their acidic end products are described, including a summary of the approximate timescales of the processes involved. Measurements and modelled calculations of spatial and temporal patterns in the deposition of acidic pollutants by both wet and dry pathways are presented.}

    Here we show that these kinetics can be understood in terms of an interplay between diffusion and HB dynamics. 
    In our model, diffusion governs whether a specific pair of water molecules are near neighbours, and HBs  between 
    such pairs form and persist at random with average lifetimes determined by rate constants for bond making and breaking."

The environmental effects on the normal modes of OH stretching vibration, their frequency shifts and hyperpolarizability are formulated and tested. The simulated SFG spectrum reproduces experimental results quite well. The surface susceptibilities of the dangling bond and hydrogen-bonded bands have opposite signs in their imaginary parts, which indicates opposite OH directions at the surface associated with these bands. The former band turns out to be sensitive only to the top monolayer, and the latter band to a few top monolayers. Further analysis reveals that those two bands arise from quite different types of molecular orientations. The assignment of the SFG spectrum is also analyzed in terms of the symmetric/antisymmetric character of the OH stretching modes and the degree of mode delocalization. ",

abstract={{The calculation of the electronic structure of large systems by methods based on density functional theory has recently gained a central role in molecular simulations. However, the extensive study of quantities like excited states and related properties is still out of reach due to high computational costs. We present a new implementation of a hybrid method, the Gaussian and Augmented-Plane-Wave (GAPW) method, where the electronic density is partitioned in hard and soft contributions. The former are local terms naturally expanded in a Gaussian basis, whereas the soft contributions are expanded in plane-waves by using a low energy cutoff, without loss in accuracy, even for all-electron calculations. For the calculation of excitation energies a recently developed, time-dependent density functional response theory (TD-DFRT) technique is joined with the GAPW procedure. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by comparison with standard quantum chemistry calculations for a set of small molecules. To highlight the performance and efficiency of GAPW we show calculations on systems with several thousands of basis functions. }}

    with permanent multipoles, but also to systems of polarizable ions where the multipoles are induced by the interionic interactions. 
    The expressions which allow for this generalization consider the ions to be spherically polarizable, but include the consequences of 
    the coupling between dipolar and quadrupolar induction. The phonon dispersion curves of MgO and the structurallattice constants of Al2O3 in its corundum phase are discussed as specific examples. In simulations with a dipole- and quadrupole-polarizable interaction model, a full Ewald summation of quadrupolar interactions is shown to have a significant effect. }}

Here, we present a combined theoretical/experimental study which provides a quantitative, molecular-level understanding of the ubiquitous and important CaF2/water interface. Our results show that, at low pH, the surface is positively charged, causing a substantial degree of water ordering. The surface charge originates primarily from the dissolution of fluoride ions, rather than from adsorption of protons to the surface. At high pH we observe the presence of Ca-OH species pointing into the water. These OH groups interact remarkably weakly with the surrounding water, and are responsible for the “free OH” signature in the VSFG spectrum, which can be explained from local electronic structure effects. The quantification of the surface termination, near-surface ion distribution and water arrangement is enabled by a combination of advanced phase-resolved Vibrational Sum Frequency Generation spectra of CaF2/water interfaces and state-of-the-art ab initio molecular dynamics simulations which include electronic structure effects.}}

pages={1075-1117},
abstract= {{This two-volume book provides an overview of physical techniques used to characterize the structure of solid materials, on the one hand, and to investigate the reactivity of their surface, on the other. Therefore this book is a must-have for anyone working in fields related to surface reactivity. Among the latter, and because of its most important industrial impact, catalysis has been used as the directing thread of the book. After the preface and a general introduction to physical techniques by M. Che and J.C. Védrine, two overviews on physical techniques are presented by G. Ertl and Sir J.M. Thomas for investigating model catalysts and porous catalysts, respectively. The book is organized into four parts: Molecular/Local Spectroscopies, Macroscopic Techniques, Characterization of the Fluid Phase (Gas and/§or Liquid), and Advanced Characterization. Each chapter focuses upon the following important themes: overview of the technique, most important parameters to interpret the experimental data, practical details, applications of the technique, particularly during chemical processes,§with its advantages and disadvantages, conclusions. }}

During the course of ISISS, invited speakers, all internationally recognized experts in the various fields of surface science, present tutorial review lectures. In addition, these experts are asked to write review articles on their lecture topic. Former ISISS speakers serve as advisors concerning the selection of speakers and lecture topics. Emphasis is given to those areas which have not been covered in depth by recent Summer Institutes, as well as to areas which have recently gained in significance and in which important progress has been made. Because of space limitations, no individual volume of Chemistry and Physics of Solid Surfaces can possibly cover the whole area of modern surface science, or even give a complete survey of recent progress in this field. However, an attempt is made to present a balanced overview in the series as a whole. With its comprehensive literature references and extensive subject indices, this series has become a valuable resource for experts and students alike. The collected articles, which stress particularly the gas-solid interface, have been published under the following titles: Surface Science: Recent Progress and Perspectives, Crit. Rev.

abstract= {{Water is a unique solvent with strong, yet highly dynamic, intermolecular interactions. Many insights into this distinctive liquid have been obtained using ultrafast vibrational spectroscopy of water's O-H stretch vibration. However, it has been challenging to separate the different contributions to the dynamics of the O-H stretch vibration in H 2 O. Here, we present a novel nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) algorithm that allows for a detailed picture of water vibrational dynamics by generating nonequilibrium vibrationally excited states at targeted vibrational frequencies. Our ab initio NEMD simulations reproduce the experimentally observed time scales of vibrational dynamics in H 2 O. The approach presented in this work uniquely disentangles the effects on the vibrational dynamics of four contributions: the delocalization of the O-H stretch mode, structural dynamics of the hydrogen bonded network, intramolecular coupling within water molecules, and intermolecular coupling between water molecules (near-resonant energy transfer between O-H groups). Our results illustrate that intermolecular energy transfer and the delocalization of the O-H stretch mode are particularly important for the spectral diffusion in H 2 O }}

simulations of all stable alkali and halide ions in water droplets.
The potentials of mean force for Cl − , Br − , and I − have shallow mini-
ma near the surface. We demonstrate that these minima derive
from more favorable water–water interaction energy when the
ions are partially desolvated. Alkali cations are on the inside
because of the favorable ion–water energy, whereas F − is driven
inside by entropy. Models attempting to explain the surface prefer-
ence based on one or more ion properties such as polarizability

The experimental methods have been developed to control the molecular structure of oil–water interface in situ. Temperature-dependent analyses have also been presented to understand the enthalpic and entropic modifications of the interfacial water molecules during a heterogeneous reaction.

We have used harmine, a β-carboline alkaloid, as an interface-sensitive fluorescent pH probe in order to measure pH changes associated with the interfacial reaction of ozone and bromide. The rate of pH change depends upon the bulk bromide concentration in a way which is well described by a Langmuir−Hinshelwood kinetic model. In the presence of octanol at the interface, the rate of pH change tracks the octanol adsorption isotherm, as expected if octanol enhances the concentration of ozone at the surface.}}

abstract= {{Anthropogenic emissions of aromatic hydrocarbons promptly react with hydroxyl radicals undergoing oxidation to form phenols and polyphenols (e.g., catechol) typically identified in the complex mixture of humic-like substances (HULIS). Because further processing of polyphenols in secondary organic aerosols (SOA) can continue mediated by a mechanism of ozonolysis at interfaces, a better understanding about how these reactions proceed at the air–water interface is needed. This work shows how catechol, a molecular probe of the oxygenated aromatic hydrocarbons present in SOA, can contribute interfacial reactive species that enhance the production of HULIS under atmospheric conditions. Reactive semiquinone radicals are quickly produced upon the encounter of 40 ppbv–6.0 ppmv O3(g) with microdroplets containing [catechol] = 1–150 μM. While the previous pathway results in the instantaneous formation of mono- and polyhydroxylated aromatic rings (PHA) and chromophoric mono- and polyhydroxylated quinones (PHQ), a different channel produces oxo- and dicarboxylic acids of low molecular weight (LMW). The cleavage of catechol occurs at the 1,2 carbon–carbon bond at the air–water interface through the formation of (1) an ozonide intermediate, (2) a hydroperoxide, and (3) cis,cis-muconic acid. However, variable [catechol] and [O3(g)] can affect the ratio of the primary products (cis,cis-muconic acid and trihydroxybenzenes) and higher order products observed (PHA, PHQ, and LMW oxo- and dicarboxylic acids). Secondary processing is confirmed by mass spectrometry, showing the production of crotonic, maleinaldehydic, maleic, glyoxylic, and oxalic acids. The proposed pathway can contribute precursors to aqueous SOA (AqSOA) formation, converting aromatic hydrocarbons into polyfunctional species widely found in tropospheric aerosols with light-absorbing brown carbon. }}

abstract ={For a series of different proteins, including a structural protein, enzyme, inhibitor, protein marker, and a charge-transfer system, we have quantified the higher affinity of Na+ over K+ to the protein surface by means of molecular dynamics simulations and conductivity measurements. Both approaches show that sodium binds at least twice as strongly to the protein surface than potassium does with this effect being present in all proteins under study. Different parts of the protein exterior are responsible to a varying degree for the higher surface affinity of sodium, with the charged carboxylic groups of aspartate and glutamate playing the most important role. Therefore, local ion pairing is the key to the surface preference of sodium over potassium, which is further demonstrated and quantified by simulations of glutamate and aspartate in the form of isolated amino acids as well as short oligopeptides. As a matter of fact, the effect is already present at the level of preferential pairing of the smallest carboxylate anions, formate or acetate, with Na+ versus K+, as shown by molecular dynamics and ab initio quantum chemical calculations. By quantifying and rationalizing the higher preference of sodium over potassium to protein surfaces, the present study opens a way to molecular understanding of many ion-specific (Hofmeister) phenomena involving protein interactions in salt solutions.},

By varying the ion concentrations in the bulk water, their adsorption isotherms were measured. It was seen that among the three, OH− has the highest adsorption energy, and H3O+ has the lowest; OH− also has the highest saturation coverage, and Cl− has the lowest. The result shows that even the neat water/OTS interface is not neutral, but charged with OH− ions. The result also explains the surprising observation that the isoelectric point appeared at ∼3.0 when HCl was used to decrease the pH starting from neat water.},

abstract = {{The rational design of improved electrode–electrolyte interfaces (EEI) for energy storage is critically dependent on a molecular-level understanding of ionic interactions and nanoscale phenomena. 
The presence of non-redox active species at EEI has been shown to strongly influence Faradaic efficiency and long-term operational stability during energy storage processes. Herein, we achieve substantially higher performance and long-term stability of EEI prepared with highly dispersed discrete redox-active cluster anions (50 ng of pure ∼0.75 nm size molybdenum polyoxometalate (POM) anions on 25 μg (∼0.2 wt%) carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes) by complete elimination of strongly coordinating non-redox species through ion soft landing (SL). Electron microscopy provides atomically resolved images of a uniform distribution of individual POM species soft landed directly on complex technologically relevant CNT electrodes. 
In this context, SL is established as a versatile approach for the controlled design of novel surfaces for both fundamental and applied research in energy storage. }}

        In most cases the surface tension increased, however in a minority of cases, certain combinations of cations and anions had a negligible effect or decreased surface tension. 
        Results were analysed in terms of surface tension/electrolyte concentration gradients (d(Δγ)/dc) and this parameter was found to correlate with the entropies of ion hydration, Jones–Dole viscosity coefficients and dissolved oxygen gradients. 
        Calculation of Gibbs surface deficiencies for selected electrolytes were carried out using the raw surface tension data. 
        Discussion of the surface tension/electrolyte concentration gradients was extended to the mechanism of inhibition of bubble coalescence by electrolytes. 
        The Gibbs–Marangoni effect did not provide a satisfactory explanation for the inhibition of coalescence for all electrolytes and from the present study we suggest that dissolved gas (microbubble) gradients between macroscopic bubbles plays an important role in the coalescence process. ",

The temperature derivative of the isentropic compressibility, κs, became zero at 2.28 and 2.90 mol kg-1 for Mg(OAc)2 and Mg(NO3)2 solutions, respectively, at 25 °C. The total hydration numbers of the dissolved ions were estimated to be, respectively, 24.3 and 19.2 at these concentrations. Differences in κs for various M2+ salts, using the present and literature data, correlated with reported M2+−OH2 bond lengths and to a lesser extent with cationic charge densities (ionic radii). The influence of anions on κs appears to follow the Hofmeister series and also correlates approximately with the anionic charge density. Substantial differences between Mg(OAc)2(aq) and Mg(NO3)2(aq) occur with respect to their structural relaxation times (derived from compressibility and viscosity data) and their electrical conductivities. These differences were attributed to a much greater ion association in Mg(OAc)2 solutions. Raman spectra recorded at 28 °C confirmed the presence of various types of contact ion pairs including mono- and bidentate complexes in Mg(OAc)2(aq). In Mg(NO3)2(aq), only noncontact ion pairs appear to be formed even at high concentrations. The experimental results are supported by molecular dynamics simulations, which also reveal the much stronger tendency of OAc- compared to NO3- to associate with Mg2+ in aqueous solutions. The simulations also allow an evaluation of the ion−ion and ion−water radial distribution functions and cumulative sums and provide a molecular picture of ion hydration in Mg(OAc)2(aq) and Mg(NO3)2(aq) at varying concentrations.",

They all exhibit a positive and a negative resonance band in the bonded-OH region, clearly different from those deduced from fitting of the χ S ( 2 ) ( ω IR) | 2 spectra, and from MD simulations. The broad continuum is characteristic of inhomogeneously broadened resonances associated with interfacial water species of various hydrogen-bonding geometries and strengths.

abstract={Dipole polarizabilities of individual ionic or molecular species are computed in three different liquid systems: liquid water, molten salts and magmatic melts, the last two belonging to the class of ionic liquids. The method is based on a purely first-principles procedure. The liquid water polarizability tensor is found to be nearly isotropic in the molecular framework. Important environmental effects occur in the two ionic systems when the nature and concentration of the cations are changed. The results of these calculations will be useful in the building of interaction potentials which include polarization effects.}

An intense resonant (IR) pump pulse vibrationally excites molecules at the surface. The subsequent population relaxation is followed by monitoring the SPG signal from a delayed pair of synchronized picosecond IR and visible probe pulses. The transient SFG experiment probes vibrational level population changes in a manner similar to familiar transient absorption experiments; the vibrationally resonant SFG nonlinear susceptibility is proportional to the population difference between the lower and upper levels of the transition. The descriptions of absorption and SFG as probes of population changes are quite similar in perturbation theory. The advantage of transient SGF measurements for surface studies is their sensitivity. Studies of methyl (CH3) groups in both large and small molecules at surfaces and methyl thiolate (CH3S) on a Ag(111) surface are reported. }}

abstract= {{ Water in contact with mineral interfaces is important for a variety of different processes. Here, we present a combined theoretical/experimental study which provides a quantitative, molecular-level understanding of the ubiquitous and important CaF2/water interface. Our results show that, at low pH, the surface is positively charged, causing a substantial degree of water ordering. The surface charge originates primarily from the dissolution of fluoride ions, rather than from adsorption of protons to the surface. At high pH we observe the presence of Ca-OH species pointing into the water. These OH groups interact remarkably weakly with the surrounding water, and are responsible for the “free OH” signature in the VSFG spectrum, which can be explained from local electronic structure effects. The quantification of the surface termination, near-surface ion distribution and water arrangement is enabled by a combination of advanced phase-resolved Vibrational Sum Frequency Generation spectra of CaF2/water interfaces and state-of-the-art ab initio molecular dynamics simulations which include electronic structure effects.}}

abstract= {{Understanding liquid water’s behavior at the molecular level is essential to progress in fields as disparate as biology and atmospheric sciences. Moreover, the properties of water in bulk and water at interfaces can be very different, making the study of the hydrogen-bonding networks therein very important. With recent experimental advances in vibrational spectroscopy, such as ultrafast pulses and heterodyne detection, it is now possible to probe the structure and dynamics of bulk and interfacial water in unprecedented detail.
We consider here three aqueous interfaces: the water liquid–vapor interface, the interface between water and the surfactant headgroups of reverse micelles, and the interface between water and the lipid headgroups of aligned multi-bilayers. In the first case, sum-frequency spectroscopy is used to probe the interface. In the second and third cases, the confined water pools are sufficiently small that techniques of bulk spectroscopy (such as FTIR, pump-probe, two-dimensional IR, and the like) can be used to probe the interfacial water. In this Account, we discuss our attempts to model these three systems and interpret the existing experiments.
For the water liquid–vapor interface, we find that three-body interactions are essential for reproducing the experimental sum-frequency spectrum, and presumably for the structure of the interface as well. The observed spectrum is interpreted as arising from overlapping and canceling positive and negative contributions from molecules in different hydrogen-bonding environments. For the reverse micelles, our theoretical models confirm that the experimentally observed blue shift of the water OD stretch (for dilute HOD in H2O) arises from weaker hydrogen bonding to sulfonate oxygens. We interpret the observed slow-down in water rotational dynamics as arising from curvature-induced frustration. For the water confined between lipid bilayers, our theoretical models confirm that the experimentally observed red shift of the water OD stretch arises from stronger hydrogen bonding to phosphate oxygens. We develop a model for heterogeneous vibrational lifetime distributions, and we implement the model to calculate isotropic and anisotropic pump-probe decays. We then compare these results with experimental data.
Clearly, recent experimental advances in vibrational spectroscopy have led to beautiful new results, providing information about the structure and dynamics of water at interfaces. These experimental and concomitant theoretical advances (particularly the unified theoretical framework of non-linear response functions) have greatly contributed to our understanding of this unique and important substance.}}

the negative charge of biological aqueous interfaces such as cell membranes and folded proteins. The diffusive

exhibits a biexponential decay.  Different  behavior  of  the  two  solvation  components
indicates that they represent different water motions. The solvation dynamics compared with the structure-

made between a dynamical relaxation mode, the slower diffusive solvation time scale

volume = {119},
pages = {5185},
abstract= {{A simple polarizable water model is developed and optimized for MD simulations of the liquid phase under ambient conditions. The permanent charge distribution of the water molecule is represented by three point charges: two hydrogen sites and one additional M site positioned along the HOH bisector. Electronic induction is represented by introducing a classical charged Drude particle attached to the oxygen by a harmonic spring. The oxygen site carries an equal and opposite charge, and is the center of an intermolecular Lennard-Jones interaction. The HOH gas-phase experimental geometry is maintained rigidly and the dipole of the isolated molecule is 1.85 D, in accord with experiment. The model is simulated by considering the dynamics of an extended Lagrangian in which a small mass is attributed to the Drude particles. It is parametrized to reproduce the salient properties of liquid water under ambient conditions. The optimal model, refered to as SWM4-DP for “simple water model with four sites and Drude polarizability,” yields a vaporizationenthalpy of 10.52 kcal/mol, a molecular volume of 29.93 Å3, a static dielectric constant of 79±5, a self-diffusion constant of (2.30±0.04)×10−5 cm2/s, and an air/water surface tension of 66.9±0.9 dyn/cm, all in excellent accord with experiments. The energy of the water dimer is −5.18 kcal/mol, in good accord with estimates from experiments and high level ab initio calculations. The polarizability of the optimal model is 1.04 Å3, which is smaller than the experimental value of 1.44 Å3 in the gas phase. It is likely that such a reduced molecular polarizability, which is essential to reproduce the properties of the liquid, arises from the energy cost of overlapping electronic clouds in the condensed phase due to Pauli’s exclusion principle opposing induction. }}

Sensitive techniques have established the preferential solvation of polarizable ions at the water surface. The experimental methods have been developed to control the molecular structure of oil–water interface in situ. Temperature-dependent analyses have also been presented to understand the enthalpic and entropic modifications of the interfacial water molecules during a heterogeneous reaction. Both of our kinetic and thermodynamic outcomes have univocally established that the hydrogen-bonding ability of the surface water molecules plays a critical role in deciding the on water organic reaction mechanism. The results have important implications on understanding the role of small water molecules adjacent to the reactants during the reactions discussed in this investigation.}}

This, along with an order of magnitude discrepancy between measured and predicted Br2 production in the reaction of ozone with deliquesced NaBr aerosol, has led to the suggestion that an interface reaction occurs between ozone and bromide. We have used harmine, a β-carboline alkaloid, as an interface-sensitive fluorescent pH probe in order to measure pH changes associated with the interfacial reaction of ozone and bromide. The rate of pH change depends upon the bulk bromide concentration in a way which is well described by a Langmuir−Hinshelwood kinetic model. In the presence of octanol at the interface, the rate of pH change tracks the octanol adsorption isotherm, as expected if octanol enhances the concentration of ozone at the surface.  }}

abstract= {{This paper reviews aspects of nonlinear optical spectroscopy of interfaces. The emphasis is put on second-order nonlinear optical techniques, such as sum-frequency generation (SFG), which possess intrinsic surface or interface selectivity and can therefore be used to probe buried interfaces accessible by light. The basic concepts of the second-order nonlinear response of surfaces and interfaces are given. While SFG in the ultraviolet-visible range allows one to achieve surface-specific electronic spectroscopy, infrared-visible SFG spectroscopy allows one to have access to absolute vibrational spectra of adsorbates at an interface.

abstract= {{The timescale of the response of solvent molecules to electronic rearrangement of solute molecules has a critical influence on the rates of chemical reactions in liquids1–10. In particular, if the solvent cannot adapt quickly enough to this rearrangement as the reactants pass through the transition state, the evolving products may recross the free-energy barrier, reducing the reaction rate. Computer simulations have shown11–18 that the response of a solvent to a change in solute charge distribution is strongly bimodal: there is an initial ultrafast response owing to inertial (mainly libra-tional) motions of the solvent molecules, followed by a slow component owing to diffusive motions. Water seems to be by far the 'fastest' solvent studied so far: simulations predict that well over half of the solvation response for atomic solutes is inertial, happening on a timescale of about 20 femtoseconds12,13. The presence of this ultrafast component implies that solvent friction plays an important role in many aqueous charge-transfer processes9,10,19–21. Experimental verification of this prediction has been lacking, however, in part because of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient time resolution. Here we present experimental measurements of the ultrafast solvation dynamics of a coumarin salt in water. When considered in conjunction with computer simulations, our results demonstrate that a solvent response on a timescale faster than 50 fs can dominate aqueous solvation dynamics.

abstract= {{We determine the profile of the vibrational band of an ordered monolayer adsorbed on a clean
surface corresponding to the infrared spectrum and to the resonant infrared-visible sum frequency
generation spectrum. The theoretical model is based on the renormalization of the monolayer and
substrate Hamiltonians. The harmonic dynamics of the effective vibrons characterizing the
collective internal vibrations of the admolecules is written in terms of a complex dynamical matrix
whose elements can be expressed as correlation functions of the external libron and phonon modes.
The dephasing broadening is obtained by solving a master equation for the time evolution of the
vibron modes while the external dynamics of the layer is described by using molecular dynamics
simulation. An application to the calculation of the profile of the vibrational band of the low
temperature (231) CO monolayer adsorbed on NaCl~100! is performed without any adjustable
parameter by considering a well established semiempirical potential to describe the
molecule-surface and molecule-molecule interactions. The comparison with experimental spectra
shows that the homogeneous phase relaxation due to the coupling between the vibrons and the
monolayer phonons-librons accounts for the most part of the peak width and interprets the
temperature dependence of this width. Extension of the calculations to the interpretation of the
orientationally disordered phase obtained for CO at higher temperature is done which corroborates
very well the temperature behavior of the monolayer structure and profile.}}

abstract= {{In the context of vibrational spectroscopy in liquids, non-Condon effects refer to the dependence of
the vibrational transition dipole moment of a particular molecule on the rotational and translational
coordinates of all the molecules in the liquid. For strongly hydrogen-bonded systems, such as liquid
water, non-Condon effects are large. That is, the bond dipole derivative of an OH stretch depends
strongly on its hydrogen-bonding environment. Previous calculations of nonlinear vibrational
spectroscopy in liquids have not included these non-Condon effects. We find that for water,
inclusion of these effects is important for an accurate calculation of, for example, homodyned and
heterodyned three-pulse echoes. Such echo experiments have been “inverted” to obtain the OH
stretch frequency time-correlation function, but by necessity the Condon and other approximations
are made in this inversion procedure. Our conclusion is that for water, primarily because of strong
non-Condon effects, this inversion may not lead to the correct frequency time-correlation function.
Nevertheless, one can still make comparison between theory and experiment by calculating the
experimental echo observables themselves.}}

with experiment. We also calculate observables associated with
three-pulse IR echoes: the peak shift and 2D-IR spectrum. The
agreement with experiment for the former is improved over our
previous calculations, but discrepancies between theory and ex-
periment still exist. Using our proposed definition for hydrogen
bonding in liquid water, we decompose the distribution of fre-
quencies in the OH stretch region in terms of subensembles of HOD
molecules with different local hydrogen-bonding environments.
Such a decomposition allows us to make the connection with

we have measured the composition of the liquid/vapor interface for deliquesced samples of potassium bromide and potassium iodide. In both
cases, the surface composition of the saturated solution is enhanced in the halide anion compared with the bulk of the solution. The enhancement of
anion concentration is more dramatic for the larger, more polarizable iodide anion. By varying photoelectron kinetic energies, we have obtained depth
profiles of the liquid/vapor interface. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with classical molecular dynamics simulations. Quantitative
comparison between the experiments and the simulations indicates that the experimental results exhibit more interface enhancement than predicted
theoretically. }}

abstract ={We performed sum-frequency generation
    (SFG) spectroscopic measurements on water in contact with
    supported thin metal and metal-oxide films. We employed an
    internal reflection configuration and varied the angles of
    incidence of the visible and infrared beams and measured the
    SFG signals using different polarization combinations. While
    SFG is a surface-specific vibrational spectroscopy, the shape of
    the SFG spectra can be fully accounted for by the bulk
    response of the materials through the frequency-dependent
    enhancement of the local incident infrared fields at the
    interface, i.e., Fresnel effects. We find that the dispersion 
    of the refractive index of the bulk water phase leads to a strong
    enhancement of the electric field at the interface at specific 
    infrared frequencies. These local, frequency-dependent fields act on
    the frequency-independent, nonresonant SFG response of the electrons
    at the surfaces of the metal or metal-oxide films. As a
    result, the measured SFG spectra closely follow this infrared 
    frequency dependence. Hence, we conclude that the nonresonant
    SFG signal from the electrons in the metal or metal-oxide film 
    strongly dominates over the resonant SFG signal of the interfacial
    water vibrations. This work demonstrates the importance of Fresnel
    factors in SFG spectroscopy of metal(-oxide)−liquid interfaces 
    and shows that the spectral dependence and magnitude of the Fresnel 
    factors can be calculated, making corrections to the data in principle 
    possible. Finally, this work provides practical recommendations for 
    the selection of suitable experimental conditions for future SFG 
    studies on metal(-oxide)−liquid interfaces aimed at elucidating 
    interfacial water structures at these interfaces.}

Phys. Chem. A 2002, 106, 11993]. It is found that the relation between the OH stretch frequency and the length of the hydrogen bond in which the OH is involved is characterized by considerable dispersion. This dispersion, which is in part related to the varying OHO angle of the hydrogen bond, precludes a one-to-one correspondence between the OH frequency and the hydrogen bond length. Further, it is found that the time scale currently interpreted in terms of a stochastic modulation by the surrounding solvent of a highly frictionally damped hydrogen bond system is largely governed by hydrogen bond-breaking and -making dynamics, while the motion of an intact hydrogen-bonded complex is underdamped in character. A detailed analysis of these issues is provided for calculated spectral dynamics after creation of a hole in the ground vibrational state, in terms of a three time analysis (in addition to the H-bond period). Further, the validity of describing the OH frequency fluctuations as a Gaussian random process is examined, as is the character of the associated autocorrelation function of the OH frequency shift.},

According to both the HF/MM and B3LYP/MM results, the ion-water interactions are relatively weak, compared to the water-water hydrogen bonds, thus causing an unstructured nature of the hydration shell. Comparing the HF and B3LYP treatments for the description of this hydrated ion, the overestimation of the ion-water hydrogen-bond strength by the B3LYP method is recognizable, yielding a remarkably more compact and too rigid ion-water complex. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},
