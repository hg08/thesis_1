As an example, a generalized Kohn-Sham procedure splitting the exchange contribution to the total energy into a screened, nonlocal and a local density component is considered.

    abstract  ="We discuss the role of the presence of dangling H-bonds from water or from surface hydroxyl species on the wetting behavior of surfaces. Using scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopies and photoelectron spectroscopy{,} we have examined a variety of surfaces{,} including mica{,} oxides and pure metals. We find that in all cases{,} the availability of free{,} dangling H-bonds at the surface is crucial for the subsequent growth of wetting water films. In the case of mica{,} electrostatic forces and H-bonding to surface O atoms determine the water orientation in the first layer and also in subsequent layers with a strong influence in its wetting characteristics. In the case of oxides like TiO2{,} Cu2O{,} SiO2 and Al2O3{,} surface hydroxyls form readily on defects upon exposure to water vapor and help nucleate the subsequent growth of molecular water films. On pure metals{,} such as Pt{,} Pd and Ru{,} the structure of the first water layer and whether or not it exhibits dangling H-bonds is again crucial. Dangling H-bonds are provided by molecules with their plane oriented vertically{,} or by OH groups formed by the partial dissociation of water. By tying the two H atoms of the water molecules into strong H-bonds with pre-adsorbed O on Ru can also quench the wettability of the surface."

abstract = {Recently, surface-sensitive spectroscopy data and molecular dynamics simulations have generated intense interest in the distribution of electrolyte ions between bulk water and the air/water interface. A partitioning model for cations and anions developed for biopolymer surface is extended here to interpret the effects of selected acids, bases, and salts on the surface tension of water. Data for electrolytes were analyzed by using a lower-bound value for the number of water molecules in the surface region [0.2 H2O {\AA}−2 (approximately two layers of water)], obtained by assuming that both Na+ and SO4 2− (i.e., Na2SO4) are fully excluded from this region. Surface–bulk partition coefficients of atmospherically relevant anions and the proton are determined. Notably, we find that H+ is most strongly surface-accumulated, I− is modestly accumulated, NO3 − is evenly distributed, and OH− is weakly excluded.}

Changes in surface potential, $\Delta$V, were found to vary from 64 mv for Na2SO4 at 1.8 m to -180 mv for NaSCN at 7.5 m. The group Ia chlorides in water gave surface-potential differences that decreased in the order K+ = NH4+ {\textgreater} Na+ {\textgreater} Li+, while the surface potentials of the group IIa cations decreased in the order Ba2+ {\textgreater} Sr2+ {\textgreater} Mg2+. At a constant anion concentration of 2 m, the surface-potential differences due to the sodium salts were in the order SO42- {\textgreater} CO32- {\textgreater} CH3COO- {\textgreater} Cl- {\textgreater} NO3- {\textgreater} Br- {\textgreater} I- {\textgreater} SCN-. In general, the anion with the smaller hydration energy gave the greatest decrease in surface potential. The magnitude of each surface-potential change, however, does not appear to be a simple function of the hydration energy. The surface-potential changes must also involve the orientation and structure of the water molecules at the water-air interface, which may be only partially dependent upon the ionic properties as determined in bulk solution.},

    abstract = {Effective pair‐potential models, parametrized to the properties of the pure liquids, have been used in molecular‐dynamics simulations of aqueous (binary) mixtures containing methanol, ammonia, or acetone. Results are reported for thermodynamic and structural properties, self‐diffusion coefficients, and reorientational correlation times. There is fair agreement with a wide variety of experimental data. The pattern of hydrogen bonding and the distribution of hydrogen‐bond lifetimes in the simulated mixtures have been investigated. The observed anomalous behavior of methanol and acetone solutions appears to be related to specific features of the hydrogen bonding—namely, the ability of these molecules to exhibit enhanced acceptor character. As a consequence of the assumed intermolecular potentials, the balance between the competing effects of hydrophobic hydration of methyl groups and hydrogen bonding to oxygen atoms is tipped towards the latter. A number of interesting structural effects have been noted. In particular, the distribution function g(R) for water oxygen atoms sharpens appreciably on addition of the second component. The structure of the water–ammonia system is discussed in detail. There is good accord with available x‐ray data at low concentration, but there are no measurements available to test the predictions at high concentration.},

    abstract = {{We have carried out first-principles Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations of heavy water using density functional theory in conjunction with either empirical van der Waals (vdW) corrections or semilocal (van der Waals) exchange and correlation functionals. Specifically, gradient-corrected density functionals (BLYP), semiempirical vdW methods (BLYP-D2, BLYP-D3, PBE-D3, revPBE-D3), and vdW density functionals (DRSLL-PBE, DRSLL-optB88) are applied to evaluate their accuracy in describing the hydrogen-bonded network of heavy water. Ab initio trajectories are used to calculate structural and dynamical properties, with special emphasis on vibrational spectral diffusion and hydrogen bond dynamics. Our results show that inclusion of vdW interactions in DFT-GGA significantly affects the structure of liquid water and results in a faster diffusion. The combination of BLYP and revPBE functionals with the semiempirical vdW method of Grimme et al. [J. Chem. Phys.2010, 132, 154104] and modified B88 functionals with the semilocal correlation functional according to M. Dion et al. [Phys. Rev.

It also has an open structure that is full of voids, especially so at low temperatures. Some of these properties are found in other fluids, but the combination of all these anomalies makes liquid water unique among all other fluids. It is thanks to these unusual properties that life evolved in water and nowhere else. To cite this article: B. Cabane, R. Vuilleumier, C. R. Geoscience 337 (2005).
Résumé
L'eau est un liquide dont les propriétés sont extraordinaires. Elle a une très grande cohésion, et une cohésion diélectrique exceptionnellement élevée, et pourtant c'est un fluide dans les conditions ambiantes de température et de pression. Ce fluide a une structure très ouverte, pleine de cavités, surtout à basse température. Certaines de ces propriétés se retrouvent dans d'autres fluides, mais leur combinaison rend l'eau vraiment unique parmi tous les fluides connus. C'est grâce à ces propriétés inhabituelles que la vie a pu se développer dans l'eau et nulle part ailleurs. Pour citer cet article : B. Cabane, R. Vuilleumier, C. R. Geoscience 337 (2005)."

    abstract = {{(1K+) In this article, time correlation function methods are used to discuss classical isomerization reactions of small nonrigid molecules in liquid solvents. Molecular expressions are derived for a macroscopic phenomenological rate constant. The form of several of these equations depend upon what ensemble is used when performing averages over initial conditions. All of these formulas, however, reduce to one final physical expression whose value is manifestly independent of ensemble. The validity of the physical expression hinges on a separation of time scales and the plateau value problem. The approximations needed to obtain transition state theory are described and the errors involved are estimated. The coupling of the reaction coordinate to the liquid medium provides the dissipation necessary for the existence of a plateau value for the rate constant, but it also leads to failures of Wigner’s fundamental assumption for transition state theory. We predict that for many isomerization reactions, the transmission coefficient will differ significantly from unity and that the difference will be a strong function of the thermodynamic state of the liquid solvent.}}

Several liquid alkanes are considered as the hydrocarbon phase in order to determine the effects of their chain length and extent of branching on the properties of the adjacent water phase. In addition to defining the interface location in terms of the laboratory-frame density profiles, the effects of interfacial fluctuations are considered by locating the interface in terms of the proximity of the molecules of the other phase. We find that the hydrogen bond dynamics of interfacial water is weakly influenced by the identity of the hydrocarbon phase and by capillary waves. In addition to calculating hydrogen bond time correlations, we examine how the hydrogen bond dynamics depend on local coordination and determine the extent of cooperativity in the population relaxation of the hydrogen bonds that a given molecule participates in.

    abstract = {This review describes the more important features of the emission, chemistry, transport and deposition of pollutants involved in acid deposition. Global emissions, both natural and man-made, of sulphur and nitrogen oxides are discussed and examples of spatial distributions and trends over the last century presented. The more significant chemical and physical processes involved in the transformation of the primary emissions into their acidic end products are described, including a summary of the approximate timescales of the processes involved. Measurements and modelled calculations of spatial and temporal patterns in the deposition of acidic pollutants by both wet and dry pathways are presented.}

The lifetime of the hydrogen bond between a PHG and a water molecule is found to be much longer than that between any two water molecules, and is likely to be a general feature of hydrophilic surfaces of organized assemblies. Analyses of individual water trajectories suggest that water molecules can remain bound to the micellar surface for more than 100 ps. The activation energy for such a transition from the bound to a free state for the water molecules is estimated to be about 3.5 kcal/mol.}},

    abstract  ="We discuss the analysis of molecular dynamics calculations where we simulate the kinetics of the breaking and forming of hydrogen bonds in distinctly different environments: liquid water and concentrated aqueous solution of DMSO. In our analysis{,} we consider reactive flux correlation functions computed for a variety of specific conditions and identify rate constants for bond making and breaking in terms of the liquid{'}s molecular dynamics. According to the proposed mechanism of hydrogen-bond kinetics{,} hydrogen bonds most frequently break during a process of switching allegiance with a newly formed bond replacing the broken one. Simulations reveal bond dynamics in the mixture to be significantly slower than in pure water. This is interpreted in terms of reduced likelihood of fluctuations in the hydrogen-bond network{,} related to the presence of free hydrogen-bonding sites{,} which participate in the process of switching allegiances. Implications of our analysis for future experimental work are briefly discussed."}

The environmental effects on the normal modes of OH stretching vibration, their frequency shifts and hyperpolarizability are formulated and tested. The simulated SFG spectrum reproduces experimental results quite well. The surface susceptibilities of the dangling bond and hydrogen-bonded bands have opposite signs in their imaginary parts, which indicates opposite OH directions at the surface associated with these bands. The former band turns out to be sensitive only to the top monolayer, and the latter band to a few top monolayers. Further analysis reveals that those two bands arise from quite different types of molecular orientations. The assignment of the SFG spectrum is also analyzed in terms of the symmetric/antisymmetric character of the OH stretching modes and the degree of mode delocalization. ",

abstract={{The calculation of the electronic structure of large systems by methods based on density functional theory has recently gained a central role in molecular simulations. However, the extensive study of quantities like excited states and related properties is still out of reach due to high computational costs. We present a new implementation of a hybrid method, the Gaussian and Augmented-Plane-Wave (GAPW) method, where the electronic density is partitioned in hard and soft contributions. The former are local terms naturally expanded in a Gaussian basis, whereas the soft contributions are expanded in plane-waves by using a low energy cutoff, without loss in accuracy, even for all-electron calculations. For the calculation of excitation energies a recently developed, time-dependent density functional response theory (TD-DFRT) technique is joined with the GAPW procedure. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by comparison with standard quantum chemistry calculations for a set of small molecules. To highlight the performance and efficiency of GAPW we show calculations on systems with several thousands of basis functions. }}

    with permanent multipoles, but also to systems of polarizable ions where the multipoles are induced by the interionic interactions. 
    The expressions which allow for this generalization consider the ions to be spherically polarizable, but include the consequences of 
    the coupling between dipolar and quadrupolar induction. The phonon dispersion curves of MgO and the structurallattice constants of Al2O3 in its corundum phase are discussed as specific examples. In simulations with a dipole- and quadrupole-polarizable interaction model, a full Ewald summation of quadrupolar interactions is shown to have a significant effect. }}

Here, we present a combined theoretical/experimental study which provides a quantitative, molecular-level understanding of the ubiquitous and important CaF2/water interface. Our results show that, at low pH, the surface is positively charged, causing a substantial degree of water ordering. The surface charge originates primarily from the dissolution of fluoride ions, rather than from adsorption of protons to the surface. At high pH we observe the presence of Ca-OH species pointing into the water. These OH groups interact remarkably weakly with the surrounding water, and are responsible for the “free OH” signature in the VSFG spectrum, which can be explained from local electronic structure effects. The quantification of the surface termination, near-surface ion distribution and water arrangement is enabled by a combination of advanced phase-resolved Vibrational Sum Frequency Generation spectra of CaF2/water interfaces and state-of-the-art ab initio molecular dynamics simulations which include electronic structure effects.}}

    abstract  ="The application of newly developed first-principle modeling techniques to liquid water deepens our understanding of the microscopic origins of its unusual macroscopic properties and behaviour. Here{,} we review two novel ab initio computational methods: second-generation Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics and decomposition analysis based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals. We show that these two methods in combination not only enable ab initio molecular dynamics simulations on previously inaccessible time and length scales{,} but also provide unprecedented insights into the nature of hydrogen bonding between water molecules. We discuss recent applications of these methods to water clusters and bulk water."

abstract= {{This two-volume book provides an overview of physical techniques used to characterize the structure of solid materials, on the one hand, and to investigate the reactivity of their surface, on the other. Therefore this book is a must-have for anyone working in fields related to surface reactivity. Among the latter, and because of its most important industrial impact, catalysis has been used as the directing thread of the book. After the preface and a general introduction to physical techniques by M. Che and J.C. Védrine, two overviews on physical techniques are presented by G. Ertl and Sir J.M. Thomas for investigating model catalysts and porous catalysts, respectively. The book is organized into four parts: Molecular/Local Spectroscopies, Macroscopic Techniques, Characterization of the Fluid Phase (Gas and/§or Liquid), and Advanced Characterization. Each chapter focuses upon the following important themes: overview of the technique, most important parameters to interpret the experimental data, practical details, applications of the technique, particularly during chemical processes,§with its advantages and disadvantages, conclusions. }}

Because of space limitations, no individual volume of Chemistry and Physics of Solid Surfaces can possibly cover the whole area of modern surface science, or even give a complete survey of recent progress in this field. However, an attempt is made to present a balanced overview in the series as a whole.

    abstract = {An empirical method to account for van der Waals interactions in practical calculations with the density functional theory (termed DFT-D) is tested for a wide variety of molecular complexes. As in previous schemes, the dispersive energy is described by damped interatomic potentials of the form C 6R-6. The use of pure, gradient-corrected density functionals (BLYP and PBE), together with the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation for the Coulomb operator, allows very efficient computations for large systems. Opposed to previous work, extended AO basis sets of polarized TZV or QZV quality are employed, which reduces the basis set superposition error to a negligible extend. By using a global scaling factor for the atomic C6 coefficients, the functional dependence of the results could be strongly reduced. The "double counting" of correlation effects for strongly bound complexes is found to be insignificant if steep damping functions are employed. The method is applied to a total of 29 complexes of atoms and small molecules (Ne, CH4, NH3, H2O, CH3F, N2, F2, formic acid, ethene, and ethine) with each other and with benzene, to benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene dimers, the naphthalene trimer, coronene {\textperiodcentered} H2O and four H-bonded and stacked DNA base pairs (AT and GC). In almost all cases, very good agreement with reliable theoretical or experimental results for binding energies and intermolecular distances is obtained. For stacked aromatic systems and the important base pairs, the DFT-D-BLYP model seems to be even superior to standard MP2 treatments that systematically overbind. The good results obtained suggest the approach as a practical tool to describe the properties of many important van der Waals systems in chemistry. Furthermore, the DFT-D data may either be used to calibrate much simpler (e.g., force-field) potentials or the optimized structures can be used as input for more accurate ab initia calculations of the interaction energies. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We review here methods to overcome this defect{,} and describe in detail a very successful correction that is based on damped –C6·R–6 potentials (DFT-D).

from more favorable water–water interaction energy when the

The experimental methods have been developed to control the molecular structure of oil–water interface in situ. Temperature-dependent analyses have also been presented to understand the enthalpic and entropic modifications of the interfacial water molecules during a heterogeneous reaction. Both of our kinetic and thermodynamic outcomes have univocally established that the hydrogen-bonding ability of the surface water molecules plays a critical role in deciding the on water organic reaction mechanism.

We have used harmine, a β-carboline alkaloid, as an interface-sensitive fluorescent pH probe in order to measure pH changes associated with the interfacial reaction of ozone and bromide. The rate of pH change depends upon the bulk bromide concentration in a way which is well described by a Langmuir−Hinshelwood kinetic model. In the presence of octanol at the interface, the rate of pH change tracks the octanol adsorption isotherm, as expected if octanol enhances the concentration of ozone at the surface.}}

Because further processing of polyphenols in secondary organic aerosols (SOA) can continue mediated by a mechanism of ozonolysis at interfaces, a better understanding about how these reactions proceed at the air–water interface is needed. This work shows how catechol, a molecular probe of the oxygenated aromatic hydrocarbons present in SOA, can contribute interfacial reactive species that enhance the production of HULIS under atmospheric conditions. Reactive semiquinone radicals are quickly produced upon the encounter of 40 ppbv–6.0 ppmv O3(g) with microdroplets containing [catechol] = 1–150 μM. While the previous pathway results in the instantaneous formation of mono- and polyhydroxylated aromatic rings (PHA) and chromophoric mono- and polyhydroxylated quinones (PHQ), a different channel produces oxo- and dicarboxylic acids of low molecular weight (LMW). The cleavage of catechol occurs at the 1,2 carbon–carbon bond at the air–water interface through the formation of (1) an ozonide intermediate, (2) a hydroperoxide, and (3) cis,cis-muconic acid. However, variable [catechol] and [O3(g)] can affect the ratio of the primary products (cis,cis-muconic acid and trihydroxybenzenes) and higher order products observed (PHA, PHQ, and LMW oxo- and dicarboxylic acids). Secondary processing is confirmed by mass spectrometry, showing the production of crotonic, maleinaldehydic, maleic, glyoxylic, and oxalic acids. The proposed pathway can contribute precursors to aqueous SOA (AqSOA) formation, converting aromatic hydrocarbons into polyfunctional species widely found in tropospheric aerosols with light-absorbing brown carbon. }}

    abstract ={For a series of different proteins, including a structural protein, enzyme, inhibitor, protein marker, and a charge-transfer system, we have quantified the higher affinity of Na+ over K+ to the protein surface by means of molecular dynamics simulations and conductivity measurements. Both approaches show that sodium binds at least twice as strongly to the protein surface than potassium does with this effect being present in all proteins under study. Different parts of the protein exterior are responsible to a varying degree for the higher surface affinity of sodium, with the charged carboxylic groups of aspartate and glutamate playing the most important role. Therefore, local ion pairing is the key to the surface preference of sodium over potassium, which is further demonstrated and quantified by simulations of glutamate and aspartate in the form of isolated amino acids as well as short oligopeptides. As a matter of fact, the effect is already present at the level of preferential pairing of the smallest carboxylate anions, formate or acetate, with Na+ versus K+, as shown by molecular dynamics and ab initio quantum chemical calculations. By quantifying and rationalizing the higher preference of sodium over potassium to protein surfaces, the present study opens a way to molecular understanding of many ion-specific (Hofmeister) phenomena involving protein interactions in salt solutions.},

abstract ={We have studied the hydrophobic water/octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) interface by using the phase-sensitive sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy (PS-SFVS), and we obtained detailed structural information of the interface at the molecular level. Excess ions emerging at the interface were detected by changes of the surface vibrational spectrum induced by the surface field created by the excess ions. Both hydronium (H3O+) and hydroxide (OH−) ions were found to adsorb at the interface, and so did other negative ions such as Cl−. By varying the ion concentrations in the bulk water, their adsorption isotherms were measured. It was seen that among the three, OH− has the highest adsorption energy, and H3O+ has the lowest; OH− also has the highest saturation coverage, and Cl− has the lowest. The result shows that even the neat water/OTS interface is not neutral, but charged with OH− ions. The result also explains the surprising observation that the isoelectric point appeared at ∼3.0 when HCl was used to decrease the pH starting from neat water.},

        Results were analysed in terms of surface tension/electrolyte concentration gradients (d(Δγ)/dc) and this parameter was found to correlate with the entropies of ion hydration, Jones–Dole viscosity coefficients and dissolved oxygen gradients. 
        Calculation of Gibbs surface deficiencies for selected electrolytes were carried out using the raw surface tension data. 
        Discussion of the surface tension/electrolyte concentration gradients was extended to the mechanism of inhibition of bubble coalescence by electrolytes.

The most promising results for large systems have been obtained{,} in our opinion{,} by perturbative vibrational approaches based on potential energy surfaces computed by hybrid (especially B3LYP) density functionals and medium size (e.g. SNSD) basis sets. In this framework{,} we are actively developing a comprehensive and robust computational protocol aimed at quantitative reproduction of the spectra of nucleic acid base complexes and their adsorption on solid supports (organic/inorganic). In this contribution we report the essential results of the first step devoted to isolated monomers and dimers. It is well known that in order to model the vibrational spectra of weakly bound molecular complexes dispersion interactions should be taken into proper account. In this work we have chosen two popular and inexpensive approaches to model dispersion interactions{,} namely the semi-empirical dispersion correction (D3) and pseudopotential based (DCP) methodologies both in conjunction with the B3LYP functional. These have been used for simulating fully anharmonic IR spectra of nucleobases and their dimers through generalized second order vibrational perturbation theory (GVPT2). We have studied{,} in particular{,} isolated adenine{,} hypoxanthine{,} uracil{,} thymine and cytosine{,} the hydrogen-bonded and stacked adenine and uracil dimers{,} and the stacked adenine–naphthalene heterodimer. Anharmonic frequencies are compared with standard B3LYP results and experimental findings{,} while the computed interaction energies and structures of complexes are compared to the best available theoretical estimates."}

The total hydration numbers of the dissolved ions were estimated to be, respectively, 24.3 and 19.2 at these concentrations. Differences in κs for various M2+ salts, using the present and literature data, correlated with reported M2+−OH2 bond lengths and to a lesser extent with cationic charge densities (ionic radii). The influence of anions on κs appears to follow the Hofmeister series and also correlates approximately with the anionic charge density. Substantial differences between Mg(OAc)2(aq) and Mg(NO3)2(aq) occur with respect to their structural relaxation times (derived from compressibility and viscosity data) and their electrical conductivities. These differences were attributed to a much greater ion association in Mg(OAc)2 solutions. Raman spectra recorded at 28 °C confirmed the presence of various types of contact ion pairs including mono- and bidentate complexes in Mg(OAc)2(aq). In Mg(NO3)2(aq), only noncontact ion pairs appear to be formed even at high concentrations. The experimental results are supported by molecular dynamics simulations, which also reveal the much stronger tendency of OAc- compared to NO3- to associate with Mg2+ in aqueous solutions. The simulations also allow an evaluation of the ion−ion and ion−water radial distribution functions and cumulative sums and provide a molecular picture of ion hydration in Mg(OAc)2(aq) and Mg(NO3)2(aq) at varying concentrations.",

abstract = {{The rational design of improved electrode–electrolyte interfaces (EEI) for energy storage is critically dependent on a molecular-level understanding of ionic interactions and nanoscale phenomena. 
The presence of non-redox active species at EEI has been shown to strongly influence Faradaic efficiency and long-term operational stability during energy storage processes. Herein, we achieve substantially higher performance and long-term stability of EEI prepared with highly dispersed discrete redox-active cluster anions (50 ng of pure ∼0.75 nm size molybdenum polyoxometalate (POM) anions on 25 μg (∼0.2 wt%) carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes) by complete elimination of strongly coordinating non-redox species through ion soft landing (SL). Electron microscopy provides atomically resolved images of a uniform distribution of individual POM species soft landed directly on complex technologically relevant CNT electrodes. 
In this context, SL is established as a versatile approach for the controlled design of novel surfaces for both fundamental and applied research in energy storage. }},

abstract={Dipole polarizabilities of individual ionic or molecular species are computed in three different liquid systems: liquid water, molten salts and magmatic melts, the last two belonging to the class of ionic liquids. The method is based on a purely first-principles procedure. The liquid water polarizability tensor is found to be nearly isotropic in the molecular framework. Important environmental effects occur in the two ionic systems when the nature and concentration of the cations are changed. The results of these calculations will be useful in the building of interaction potentials which include polarization effects.}

Hydrogen bonding O-H stretching features are strongly dependent on which fragmentation channel is monitored. Spectra recorded by monitoring the loss of multiple waters show a preference for one absorption feature in the hydrogen-bonded region centered at ∼3430–3500 cm−1, which is assigned to linear-type hydrogen bonded OH stretches. Cyclic- and bent-type hydrogen bonded OH stretches have diminished photodissociation cross sections in the multiple ligand loss channels. Evidence from Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus–evaporative ensemble calculations and laser fluence dependence experiments indicates that the multiple water loss channels are primarily the result of multiple photon absorption which we propose could be due to multiple, independent oscillators within a cluster ion each absorbing a photon during a single, 10 ns laser pulse.}},

abstract= {{Understanding liquid water’s behavior at the molecular level is essential to progress in fields as disparate as biology and atmospheric sciences. Moreover, the properties of water in bulk and water at interfaces can be very different, making the study of the hydrogen-bonding networks therein very important. With recent experimental advances in vibrational spectroscopy, such as ultrafast pulses and heterodyne detection, it is now possible to probe the structure and dynamics of bulk and interfacial water in unprecedented detail.
We consider here three aqueous interfaces: the water liquid–vapor interface, the interface between water and the surfactant headgroups of reverse micelles, and the interface between water and the lipid headgroups of aligned multi-bilayers. In the first case, sum-frequency spectroscopy is used to probe the interface. In the second and third cases, the confined water pools are sufficiently small that techniques of bulk spectroscopy (such as FTIR, pump-probe, two-dimensional IR, and the like) can be used to probe the interfacial water. In this Account, we discuss our attempts to model these three systems and interpret the existing experiments.
For the water liquid–vapor interface, we find that three-body interactions are essential for reproducing the experimental sum-frequency spectrum, and presumably for the structure of the interface as well. The observed spectrum is interpreted as arising from overlapping and canceling positive and negative contributions from molecules in different hydrogen-bonding environments. For the reverse micelles, our theoretical models confirm that the experimentally observed blue shift of the water OD stretch (for dilute HOD in H2O) arises from weaker hydrogen bonding to sulfonate oxygens. We interpret the observed slow-down in water rotational dynamics as arising from curvature-induced frustration. For the water confined between lipid bilayers, our theoretical models confirm that the experimentally observed red shift of the water OD stretch arises from stronger hydrogen bonding to phosphate oxygens. We develop a model for heterogeneous vibrational lifetime distributions, and we implement the model to calculate isotropic and anisotropic pump-probe decays. We then compare these results with experimental data.
Clearly, recent experimental advances in vibrational spectroscopy have led to beautiful new results, providing information about the structure and dynamics of water at interfaces. These experimental and concomitant theoretical advances (particularly the unified theoretical framework of non-linear response functions) have greatly contributed to our understanding of this unique and important substance.}}

The second harmonic generation was used as a surface-specific ultrafast probe. The results are compared with the solvation dynamics measured for the same probe molecule at the air−water interface without the surfactant. The overall solvation time in the presence of the fatty acid monolayer (τs = 400 ± 60 fs) differs from that at the air−water interface, where two components τ1 = 250 ± 60 fs and τ2 = 1250 ± 80 fs were obtained, with an amplitude weighted average solvation time of τs = 850 ± 70 fs. These results are in agreement with bulk studies of coumarins in water. The different solvation dynamics at the surfactant modified interface is attributed to rearrangement of the hydrogen bonding network of water molecules near the interface due to interactions with the hydrophilic carboxyl group of the surfactant.}}

    abstract= {{A simple polarizable water model is developed and optimized for MD simulations of the liquid phase under ambient conditions. The permanent charge distribution of the water molecule is represented by three point charges: two hydrogen sites and one additional M site positioned along the HOH bisector. Electronic induction is represented by introducing a classical charged Drude particle attached to the oxygen by a harmonic spring. The oxygen site carries an equal and opposite charge, and is the center of an intermolecular Lennard-Jones interaction. The HOH gas-phase experimental geometry is maintained rigidly and the dipole of the isolated molecule is 1.85 D, in accord with experiment. The model is simulated by considering the dynamics of an extended Lagrangian in which a small mass is attributed to the Drude particles. It is parametrized to reproduce the salient properties of liquid water under ambient conditions. The optimal model, refered to as SWM4-DP for “simple water model with four sites and Drude polarizability,” yields a vaporizationenthalpy of 10.52 kcal/mol, a molecular volume of 29.93 Å3, a static dielectric constant of 79±5, a self-diffusion constant of (2.30±0.04)×10−5 cm2/s, and an air/water surface tension of 66.9±0.9 dyn/cm, all in excellent accord with experiments. The energy of the water dimer is −5.18 kcal/mol, in good accord with estimates from experiments and high level ab initio calculations. The polarizability of the optimal model is 1.04 Å3, which is smaller than the experimental value of 1.44 Å3 in the gas phase. It is likely that such a reduced molecular polarizability, which is essential to reproduce the properties of the liquid, arises from the energy cost of overlapping electronic clouds in the condensed phase due to Pauli’s exclusion principle opposing induction. }}

The emphasis is put on second-order nonlinear optical techniques, such as sum-frequency generation (SFG), which possess intrinsic surface or interface selectivity and can therefore be used to probe buried interfaces accessible by light. The basic concepts of the second-order nonlinear response of surfaces and interfaces are given. While SFG in the ultraviolet-visible range allows one to achieve surface-specific electronic spectroscopy, infrared-visible SFG spectroscopy allows one to have access to absolute vibrational spectra of adsorbates at an interface. The main experimental schemes commonly employed are described. Selected experimental examples are given for studies of liquid surfaces and interfaces, polymer surfaces and interfaces, solid surfaces under ultra-high vacuum conditions or in inert atmospheres, solid-gas interfaces, solid-liquid interfaces and solid-solid interfaces. Both frequency-resolved studies and time-domain measurements are addressed.}}

solute molecules has a critical influence on the rates of chemical reactions in liquids. 
In particular, if the solvent cannot adapt quickly enough to this rearrangement as the 
reactants pass through the transition state, the evolving products may recross the free-energy barrier, 
reducing the reaction rate. Computer simulations have shown that the response of a solvent 
to a change in solute charge distribution is strongly bimodal: there is an initial ultrafast response
 owing to inertial (mainly libra-tional) motions of the solvent molecules, followed by a slow component owing to diffusive motions. Water seems to be by far the 'fastest' solvent studied so far: simulations predict that well over half of the solvation response for atomic solutes is inertial, 
happening on a timescale of about 20 femtoseconds. The presence of this ultrafast component implies that solvent friction plays
 an important role in many aqueous charge-transfer processes. Experimental verification of this prediction has been lacking, however, 
in part because of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient time resolution. Here we present experimental measurements of the ultrafast solvation dynamics of a coumarin salt in water.
When considered in conjunction with computer simulations, our results demonstrate that a solvent response on a timescale faster than 50 fs can dominate aqueous solvation dynamics.

abstract= {{We determine the profile of the vibrational band of an ordered monolayer adsorbed on a clean
surface corresponding to the infrared spectrum and to the resonant infrared-visible sum frequency
generation spectrum. The theoretical model is based on the renormalization of the monolayer and
substrate Hamiltonians. The harmonic dynamics of the effective vibrons characterizing the
collective internal vibrations of the admolecules is written in terms of a complex dynamical matrix
whose elements can be expressed as correlation functions of the external libron and phonon modes.
The dephasing broadening is obtained by solving a master equation for the time evolution of the
vibron modes while the external dynamics of the layer is described by using molecular dynamics
simulation. An application to the calculation of the profile of the vibrational band of the low
temperature (231) CO monolayer adsorbed on NaCl~100! is performed without any adjustable
parameter by considering a well established semiempirical potential to describe the
molecule-surface and molecule-molecule interactions. The comparison with experimental spectra
shows that the homogeneous phase relaxation due to the coupling between the vibrons and the
monolayer phonons-librons accounts for the most part of the peak width and interprets the
temperature dependence of this width. Extension of the calculations to the interpretation of the
orientationally disordered phase obtained for CO at higher temperature is done which corroborates
very well the temperature behavior of the monolayer structure and profile.}}

However, the microscopic mechanism of their effective preservation abilities remains unclear. In this article we present a molecular dynamics simulation study of the short time, less than 1ns1ns, dynamics of four trehalose-glycerol mixtures at temperatures below the glass transition temperature. We found that a mixture of 5\% glycerol and 95\% trehalose has the most suppressed short time dynamics (fast dynamics). This result agrees with the experimental analysis of the mean-square displacement of the hydrogen atoms, as measured via neutron scattering, and correlates with the experimentally observed enhancement of the stability of some enzymes at this particular concentration. Our microscopic analysis suggests that the formation of a robust intermolecular hydrogen bonding network is most effective at this concentration and is the main mechanism for the suppression of the fast dynamics.}},

In particular, the ability to decompose the solvation free energy into simple and intuitive contributions will have important implications for models of electrolyte solution. Here, we provide definitions of the various types of single ion solvation free energies based on different simulation protocols. We calculate solvation free energies of charged hard spheres using density functional theory interaction potentials with molecular dynamics simulation and isolate the effects of charge and cavitation, comparing to the Born (linear response) model. We show that using uncorrected Ewald summation leads to unphysical values for the single ion solvation free energy and that charging free energies for cations are approximately linear as a function of charge but that there is a small non-linearity for small anions. The charge hydration asymmetry for hard spheres, determined with quantum mechanics, is much larger than for the analogous real ions. This suggests that real ions, particularly anions, are significantly more complex than simple charged hard spheres, a commonly employed representation.}},

    water, non-Condon effects are large. That is, the bond dipole derivative of an OH stretch depends
    strongly on its hydrogen-bonding environment. Previous calculations of nonlinear vibrational
    spectroscopy in liquids have not included these non-Condon effects. We find that for water,
    inclusion of these effects is important for an accurate calculation of, for example, homodyned and
    heterodyned three-pulse echoes. Such echo experiments have been “inverted” to obtain the OH
    stretch frequency time-correlation function, but by necessity the Condon and other approximations
    are made in this inversion procedure. Our conclusion is that for water, primarily because of strong
    non-Condon effects, this inversion may not lead to the correct frequency time-correlation function.
    Nevertheless, one can still make comparison between theory and experiment by calculating the
    experimental echo observables themselves.}}

Using differently sized surface models: p(2 × 2), p(4 × 4) and p(4 × 5), we found out that the adsorption energy of a H2O monomer does not significantly change with the surface model though the adsorption geometry is sensitive to the choice of the super-cell surface and, also, to the coverage. Molecular dynamics simulations on the Born-Oppenheimer surface of liquid water on a Cu(111) surface reveal that H2O in the first solvent layer adsorbs O-down and that the H-bond network is weaker upon adsorption on the Cu.

    abstract = {{A theoretical study of the H2O-Au(1 1 1) interface based on first principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations with and without inclusion of dispersion correction is reported. Three different computational approaches are considered. First, the standard generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional PBE is employed. Second, an additional energy term is further included that adds a semi-empirically derived dispersion correction (PBE-D2), and, finally, a recently proposed functional that includes van der Waals (vdW) interactions directly in its functional form (optB86b-vdW) was used to represent the state-of-the art of DFT functionals. The monomeric water adsorption was first considered in order to explore the dependency of geometry on the details of the model slab used to represent it (size, thickness, coverage). When the dispersion corrections are included the Au-H2O interaction is stronger, as manifested by the smaller dAu-O and stronger adsorption energies. Additionally, the interfacial region between Au(1 1 1) slab surfaces and a liquid water layer was investigated with Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) using the same functionals. Two or three interfacial orientations can be determined, depending on the theoretical methodology applied. Closest to the surface, H2O is adsorbed O-down, whereas further away it is oriented with one OH bond pointing to the surface and the molecular plane parallel to the normal direction. For the optB86b-vdW functional a third orientation is found where one H atom points into the bulk water layer and the second OH bond is oriented parallel to the metal surface. As for the water density in the first adsorption layer we find a very small increase of roughly 8%. From the analysis of vibrational spectra a weakening of the H-bond network is observed upon the inclusion of the Au(1 1 1) slab, however, no disruption of H-bonds is observed. While the PBE and PBE-D2 spectra are very similar, the optB86b-vdW spectrum shows that the H-bonds are even more weakened.}},

Different adsorption sites and water orientations were considered. A full geometry optimization for a water molecule at the on-top adsorption site of the Cu10 cluster gave 77 degrees for the optimal tilt angle between the water plane and the surface normal, and non-CP interaction energy of −41 kJ/mol. Interaction energies between a Cu18 model cluster and H2O were also calculated at selected points. Without the CP correction, the orientation with hydrogens parallel to the Cu18 surface was the most favorable with interaction energy of −48 kJ/mol. After CP correction, the interaction was significantly weaker and the orientation with hydrogens toward the surface was the most favorable energetically for the chosen method with a CP-corrected minimum of −16 kJ/mol.}},

Surface water with one hydrogen free of hydrogen bonding, a “free OH”, decreases in concentration as the sulfuric acid concentration is increased. Finally, there are no sulfuric acid free OH groups projecting out of the surface for solutions from 0.01x to 0.9x sulfuric acid.

Here, we report the development of full-dimensional many-body potential energy functions, called MB-nrg (Many-Body-energy), for molecular simulations of halide ion–water systems from the gas phase to the condensed phase. The MB-nrg potentials are derived entirely from “first-principles” calculations carried out at the F12 explicitly correlated coupled-cluster level including single, double, and perturbative triple excitations, CCSD(T)-F12, in the complete basis set limit. Building upon the functional form of the MB-pol water potential, the MB-nrg potentials are expressed through the many-body expansion of the total energy in terms of explicit contributions representing one-body, two-body, and three-body interactions, with all higher-order contributions being described by classical induction. The specific focus of this study is on the MB-nrg two-body terms representing the full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) of the corresponding H2O–X– dimers, with X–= F–, Cl–, Br–, and I–. The accuracy of the MB-nrg PESs is systematically assessed through extensive comparisons with results obtained using both ab initio models and polarizable force fields for energies, structures, and harmonic frequencies of the H2O–X– dimers.}},

The effect on surface structure resulting from molecular variation (i.e., addition of cyano- and methoxy-functional groups) of the cation alkyl chain was investigated. SFG spectra in the C—H stretching region (2750–3100 cm−1) for [P8 8 8 n][Cl], where n = 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, or 14, showed characteristic changes as the alkyl chain length was increased. Spectral profiles for n = 4, 5, 8, or 10 appeared similar; however, when the fourth alkyl chain was sufficiently long (as in the case of n = 12 or n = 14), abrupt changes occurred in the spectra. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of a slab of each ionic liquid (with n = 8, 10, or 12) confirmed gauche defects, with enhancement for the long alkyl chain and an abrupt increase of gauche occurrence from n = 8 to n = 10. A comparison of the tilt angle distribution from the simulation and the SFG analysis show a broad distribution of angles. Using experimental SFG spectra in conjunction with MD simulations, a comprehensive molecular picture at the surface of this unique class of liquids is presented}

  abstract = {The role of aqueous surfaces in promoting atmospheric chemistry is increasingly being recognized. However, the bimolecular chemistries of Criegee intermediates, which influence the tropospheric budget of OH radicals, organic acids, hydroperoxides, nitrates, sulfates, and particulate material, remain less explored on an aqueous surface. Herein we have employed Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations and two-layer ONIOM (QM:MM) in an electronic embedding scheme to study the reaction and the spectroscopic signal of anti-CH3CHOO with nitric acid (HNO3) at the air–water interface, which is expected to be an important reaction in polluted urban environments. The results reveal that on the water surface, the HNO3-mediated hydration of anti-CH3CHOO is the most dominant pathway, whereas the traditionally believed direct reaction between anti-CH3CHOO and HNO3, which results in the formation of nitrooxyethyl hydroperoxide, is only the minor channel. Both reaction pathways follow a stepwise mechanism at the air–water interface and occur on the picosecond time scale. These new reactions are expected to be relevant in the hazy environments of globally polluted urban regions where nitrates and sulfates are abundantly present. During the hazy period, the high relative humidity and the presence of fog droplets may favor the HNO3-mediated Criegee hydration over the nitrooxyethyl hydroperoxide forming reaction. A similar reaction mechanism with Criegee intermediates could be expected on the water surface for organic acids, which possess HNO3-like functionalities, and may play a role in improving our knowledge of the organic acid budget in the terrestrial equatorial regions and high northern latitudes. The ONIOM calculations suggest that the N–O stretching bands around 1600–1200 cm–1 and NO2 bending band around 750 cm–1 in nitrooxyethyl hydroperoxide could be used as spectroscopic markers for distinguishing it from hydrooxyethyl hydroperoxide on the water surface.}

abstract = {Molecular Dynamics simulations are used to examine several key aspects of recent ultrafast infrared experiments on liquid water dynamics in an amplified and extended version of a recent communication [J. Phys. Chem. A 2002, 106, 11993]. It is found that the relation between the OH stretch frequency and the length of the hydrogen bond in which the OH is involved is characterized by considerable dispersion. This dispersion, which is in part related to the varying OHO angle of the hydrogen bond, precludes a one-to-one correspondence between the OH frequency and the hydrogen bond length. Further, it is found that the time scale currently interpreted in terms of a stochastic modulation by the surrounding solvent of a highly frictionally damped hydrogen bond system is largely governed by hydrogen bond-breaking and -making dynamics, while the motion of an intact hydrogen-bonded complex is underdamped in character. A detailed analysis of these issues is provided for calculated spectral dynamics after creation of a hole in the ground vibrational state, in terms of a three time analysis (in addition to the H-bond period). Further, the validity of describing the OH frequency fluctuations as a Gaussian random process is examined, as is the character of the associated autocorrelation function of the OH frequency shift.},

According to both the HF/MM and B3LYP/MM results, the ion-water interactions are relatively weak, compared to the water-water hydrogen bonds, thus causing an unstructured nature of the hydration shell. Comparing the HF and B3LYP treatments for the description of this hydrated ion, the overestimation of the ion-water hydrogen-bond strength by the B3LYP method is recognizable, yielding a remarkably more compact and too rigid ion-water complex. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

    title = {{For the chosen time step and number of steps, the frequency range we can obtain for the VDOS is (3, 3.3$\times10^4$)cm$^{-1}$  (from the Nyquist criterion). 
It is reasonable to analyze vibrations of water molecules whose frequencies are in (1600, 3800)cm$^{-1}$.
To obtain the vibrations with the highest frequecies $\nu_\text{max}$, the sampling rates $f_{s}$ must be at least as high as $f_s=2\nu_\text{max}$, thus, the time step $\Delta{t}$ must satisfy $\Delta{t}\leq{1}/{2\nu_\text{max}}$.
   If $f_{s}$ is known, the upper bound of vibrational frequencies $\nu_\text{max}$ can be calculated.
   For a sequence with $M$ steps, the maximun period $T_\text{max}=\Delta{t}$ (the maximum frequency ${f_s}_\text{max}=1/{\Delta{t}}$).
   $f_{s_\text{max}}=2\nu_\text{max}$, then $\nu_\text{max}={f_s}_\text{max}/{2}=1/{2\Delta{t}}$.
   In our simulation, the time step is 0.5 fs and the total number of steps $M\approx10^4$. Thus the frequency range of the VDOS is in $(3.3, 3.3\times 10^4)$ cm$^{-1}$.
   In this thesis, we consider the vibrational modes of water molecules in (1600, 3800) cm$^{-1}$.
   The time step is 0.5 fs.}}

    In our model, diffusion governs whether a specific pair of water molecules are near neighbours, and HBs  between 
    such pairs form and persist at random with average lifetimes determined by rate constants for bond making and breaking."

abstract={{The calculation of the electronic structure of large systems by methods based on density functional theory has recently gained a central role in molecular simulations. However, the extensive study of quantities like excited states and related properties is still out of reach due to high computational costs. We present a new implementation of a hybrid method, the Gaussian and Augmented-Plane-Wave (GAPW) method, where the electronic density is partitioned in hard and soft contributions. The former are local terms naturally expanded in a Gaussian basis, whereas the soft contributions are expanded in plane-waves by using a low energy cutoff, without loss in accuracy, even for all-electron calculations. For the calculation of excitation energies a recently developed, time-dependent density functional response theory (TD-DFRT) technique is joined with the GAPW procedure. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by comparison with standard quantum chemistry calculations for a set of small molecules. To highlight the performance and efficiency of GAPW we show calculations on systems with several thousands of basis functions. }}

    The expressions which allow for this generalization consider the ions to be spherically polarizable, but include the consequences of 
    the coupling between dipolar and quadrupolar induction. The phonon dispersion curves of MgO and the structurallattice constants of Al2O3 in its corundum phase are discussed as specific examples. In simulations with a dipole- and quadrupole-polarizable interaction model, a full Ewald summation of quadrupolar interactions is shown to have a significant effect. }}

In all of these contexts, the relevant properties of clay minerals are intimately linked to their
microscopic structure, which results in a rich behavior with respect to water, solutes, and
other fl uids. This article provides a brief overview of the structure, dynamics, thermodynamics,
and reactivity of water in clays, highlighting the role of the various types of water–mineral
interfaces. Based on recent experimental and simulation studies, we discuss several features
of these interfacial materials arising from their interactions with water on the molecular scale,
including swelling, wetting, hydrodynamics in clay nanopores, reactivity of clay edge sites,

abstract ={For a series of different proteins, including a structural protein, enzyme, inhibitor, protein marker, and a charge-transfer system, we have quantified the higher affinity of Na+ over K+ to the protein surface by means of molecular dynamics simulations and conductivity measurements. Both approaches show that sodium binds at least twice as strongly to the protein surface than potassium does with this effect being present in all proteins under study. Different parts of the protein exterior are responsible to a varying degree for the higher surface affinity of sodium, with the charged carboxylic groups of aspartate and glutamate playing the most important role. Therefore, local ion pairing is the key to the surface preference of sodium over potassium, which is further demonstrated and quantified by simulations of glutamate and aspartate in the form of isolated amino acids as well as short oligopeptides. As a matter of fact, the effect is already present at the level of preferential pairing of the smallest carboxylate anions, formate or acetate, with Na+ versus K+, as shown by molecular dynamics and ab initio quantum chemical calculations. By quantifying and rationalizing the higher preference of sodium over potassium to protein surfaces, the present study opens a way to molecular understanding of many ion-specific (Hofmeister) phenomena involving protein interactions in salt solutions.},

        In most cases the surface tension increased, however in a minority of cases, certain combinations of cations and anions had a negligible effect or decreased surface tension. 
        Results were analysed in terms of surface tension/electrolyte concentration gradients (d(Δγ)/dc) and this parameter was found to correlate with the entropies of ion hydration, Jones–Dole viscosity coefficients and dissolved oxygen gradients. 
        Calculation of Gibbs surface deficiencies for selected electrolytes were carried out using the raw surface tension data. 
        Discussion of the surface tension/electrolyte concentration gradients was extended to the mechanism of inhibition of bubble coalescence by electrolytes. 
        The Gibbs–Marangoni effect did not provide a satisfactory explanation for the inhibition of coalescence for all electrolytes and from the present study we suggest that dissolved gas (microbubble) gradients between macroscopic bubbles plays an important role in the coalescence process. ",

abstract = "Neutron diffraction with isotopic substitution (NDIS) experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to study the structuring in aqueous solution of two cesium salts, cesium carbonate, and cesium nitrate. As was previously found for guanidinium salts of carbonate, mesoscopic-scale clusters were seen to form in the Cs2CO3 solution both in the MD simulations and in the diffraction experiments. No such large scale ion clusters were found in the CsNO3 solutions in either the modeling or experiments. The results are dominated by the strength and geometry of the direct first-neighbor interactions, which explain the differences in the clustering behavior between the two solutions without need to refer to longer-range water−water structuring.",

abstract = "The ultrasonic velocities, densities, viscosities, and electrical conductivities of aqueous solutions of magnesium nitrate and magnesium acetate have been measured from dilute to saturation concentrations at 0 ≤ t/°C ≤ 50. The temperature derivative of the isentropic compressibility, κs, became zero at 2.28 and 2.90 mol kg-1 for Mg(OAc)2 and Mg(NO3)2 solutions, respectively, at 25 °C. The total hydration numbers of the dissolved ions were estimated to be, respectively, 24.3 and 19.2 at these concentrations. Differences in κs for various M2+ salts, using the present and literature data, correlated with reported M2+−OH2 bond lengths and to a lesser extent with cationic charge densities (ionic radii). The influence of anions on κs appears to follow the Hofmeister series and also correlates approximately with the anionic charge density. Substantial differences between Mg(OAc)2(aq) and Mg(NO3)2(aq) occur with respect to their structural relaxation times (derived from compressibility and viscosity data) and their electrical conductivities. These differences were attributed to a much greater ion association in Mg(OAc)2 solutions. Raman spectra recorded at 28 °C confirmed the presence of various types of contact ion pairs including mono- and bidentate complexes in Mg(OAc)2(aq). In Mg(NO3)2(aq), only noncontact ion pairs appear to be formed even at high concentrations. The experimental results are supported by molecular dynamics simulations, which also reveal the much stronger tendency of OAc- compared to NO3- to associate with Mg2+ in aqueous solutions. The simulations also allow an evaluation of the ion−ion and ion−water radial distribution functions and cumulative sums and provide a molecular picture of ion hydration in Mg(OAc)2(aq) and Mg(NO3)2(aq) at varying concentrations.",

They all exhibit a positive and a negative resonance band in the bonded-OH region, clearly different from those deduced from fitting of the χ S ( 2 ) ( ω IR) | 2 spectra, and from MD simulations. The broad continuum is characteristic of inhomogeneously broadened resonances associated with interfacial water species of various hydrogen-bonding geometries and strengths. Spectral changes due to excess ions at the interfaces support the picture."

This dependence is due to the polarization of water molecules in the electrostatic field of the charged monolayer. The observed linear dependence of the second harmonic field on the interface electric potential serves as the basis of a proposed method for obtaining the interface potential, which it should be noted is a nonintrusive optical method. The work presented here also indicates that the Gouy—Chapman model is valid at the air/water charged interface up to at least a 1 M total electrolyte concentration. "

Important environmental effects occur in the two ionic systems when the nature and concentration of the cations are changed. The results of these calculations will be useful in the building of interaction potentials which include polarization effects.}

abstract= {{Understanding liquid water’s behavior at the molecular level is essential to progress in fields as disparate as biology and atmospheric sciences. Moreover, the properties of water in bulk and water at interfaces can be very different, making the study of the hydrogen-bonding networks therein very important. With recent experimental advances in vibrational spectroscopy, such as ultrafast pulses and heterodyne detection, it is now possible to probe the structure and dynamics of bulk and interfacial water in unprecedented detail.
We consider here three aqueous interfaces: the water liquid–vapor interface, the interface between water and the surfactant headgroups of reverse micelles, and the interface between water and the lipid headgroups of aligned multi-bilayers. In the first case, sum-frequency spectroscopy is used to probe the interface. In the second and third cases, the confined water pools are sufficiently small that techniques of bulk spectroscopy (such as FTIR, pump-probe, two-dimensional IR, and the like) can be used to probe the interfacial water. In this Account, we discuss our attempts to model these three systems and interpret the existing experiments.
For the water liquid–vapor interface, we find that three-body interactions are essential for reproducing the experimental sum-frequency spectrum, and presumably for the structure of the interface as well. The observed spectrum is interpreted as arising from overlapping and canceling positive and negative contributions from molecules in different hydrogen-bonding environments. For the reverse micelles, our theoretical models confirm that the experimentally observed blue shift of the water OD stretch (for dilute HOD in H2O) arises from weaker hydrogen bonding to sulfonate oxygens. We interpret the observed slow-down in water rotational dynamics as arising from curvature-induced frustration. For the water confined between lipid bilayers, our theoretical models confirm that the experimentally observed red shift of the water OD stretch arises from stronger hydrogen bonding to phosphate oxygens. We develop a model for heterogeneous vibrational lifetime distributions, and we implement the model to calculate isotropic and anisotropic pump-probe decays. We then compare these results with experimental data.
Clearly, recent experimental advances in vibrational spectroscopy have led to beautiful new results, providing information about the structure and dynamics of water at interfaces. These experimental and concomitant theoretical advances (particularly the unified theoretical framework of non-linear response functions) have greatly contributed to our understanding of this unique and important substance.}}

abstract= {{This paper reviews aspects of nonlinear optical spectroscopy of interfaces. The emphasis is put on second-order nonlinear optical techniques, such as sum-frequency generation (SFG), which possess intrinsic surface or interface selectivity and can therefore be used to probe buried interfaces accessible by light. The basic concepts of the second-order nonlinear response of surfaces and interfaces are given. While SFG in the ultraviolet-visible range allows one to achieve surface-specific electronic spectroscopy, infrared-visible SFG spectroscopy allows one to have access to absolute vibrational spectra of adsorbates at an interface. The main experimental schemes commonly employed are described. Selected experimental examples are given for studies of liquid surfaces and interfaces, polymer surfaces and interfaces, solid surfaces under ultra-high vacuum conditions or in inert atmospheres, solid-gas interfaces, solid-liquid interfaces and solid-solid interfaces. Both frequency-resolved studies and time-domain measurements are addressed.}}

abstract= {{We determine the profile of the vibrational band of an ordered monolayer adsorbed on a clean
surface corresponding to the infrared spectrum and to the resonant infrared-visible sum frequency
generation spectrum. The theoretical model is based on the renormalization of the monolayer and
substrate Hamiltonians. The harmonic dynamics of the effective vibrons characterizing the
collective internal vibrations of the admolecules is written in terms of a complex dynamical matrix
whose elements can be expressed as correlation functions of the external libron and phonon modes.
The dephasing broadening is obtained by solving a master equation for the time evolution of the
vibron modes while the external dynamics of the layer is described by using molecular dynamics
simulation. An application to the calculation of the profile of the vibrational band of the low
temperature (231) CO monolayer adsorbed on NaCl~100! is performed without any adjustable
parameter by considering a well established semiempirical potential to describe the
molecule-surface and molecule-molecule interactions. The comparison with experimental spectra
shows that the homogeneous phase relaxation due to the coupling between the vibrons and the
monolayer phonons-librons accounts for the most part of the peak width and interprets the
temperature dependence of this width. Extension of the calculations to the interpretation of the
orientationally disordered phase obtained for CO at higher temperature is done which corroborates
very well the temperature behavior of the monolayer structure and profile.}}

abstract ={We performed sum-frequency generation
    (SFG) spectroscopic measurements on water in contact with
    supported thin metal and metal-oxide films. We employed an
    internal reflection configuration and varied the angles of
    incidence of the visible and infrared beams and measured the
    SFG signals using different polarization combinations. While
    SFG is a surface-specific vibrational spectroscopy, the shape of
    the SFG spectra can be fully accounted for by the bulk
    response of the materials through the frequency-dependent
    enhancement of the local incident infrared fields at the
    interface, i.e., Fresnel effects. We find that the dispersion 
    of the refractive index of the bulk water phase leads to a strong
    enhancement of the electric field at the interface at specific 
    infrared frequencies. These local, frequency-dependent fields act on
    the frequency-independent, nonresonant SFG response of the electrons
    at the surfaces of the metal or metal-oxide films. As a
    result, the measured SFG spectra closely follow this infrared 
    frequency dependence. Hence, we conclude that the nonresonant
    SFG signal from the electrons in the metal or metal-oxide film 
    strongly dominates over the resonant SFG signal of the interfacial
    water vibrations. This work demonstrates the importance of Fresnel
    factors in SFG spectroscopy of metal(-oxide)−liquid interfaces 
    and shows that the spectral dependence and magnitude of the Fresnel 
    factors can be calculated, making corrections to the data in principle 
    possible. Finally, this work provides practical recommendations for 
    the selection of suitable experimental conditions for future SFG 
    studies on metal(-oxide)−liquid interfaces aimed at elucidating 
    interfacial water structures at these interfaces.}

Basic concepts offered for describing the structure and dynamics of water are considered. The structure of water is currently viewed as having a uniform three-dimensional network formed by hydrogen-bonded molecules. The arrangement of this network is dissimilar from that found in any crystal structures; it is dynamically and structurally inhomogeneous. The network is rather labile; water molecules continuously change their neighbors, so that the average lifetime of hydrogen bonds is about a few picoseconds.}}

At ambient temperatures most molecules favor a closer packing than tetrahedral, with strongly distorted hydrogen bonds, which allows the quantized librational modes to be excited and contribute to the entropy, but with enthalpically favored tetrahedrally bonded water patches appearing as fluctuations, i.e. a competition between entropy and enthalpy. Upon cooling water the amount of molecules participating in tetrahedral structures and the size of the tetrahedral patches increase. The two local structures are connected to the liquid–liquid critical point hypothesis in supercooled water corresponding to high density liquid and low density liquid. We will discuss the interpretation of X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray emission spectroscopy, wide and small angle X-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulations in light of the current debate."

abstract = "Here we discuss the structure of water in terms of a temperature-dependent balance between two classes of hydrogen-bonded structures. At high and down to mildly supercooled temperatures most molecules favor a closer packing than tetrahedral, with strongly distorted hydrogen bonds. This allows the quantized librational modes to be excited and contribute to the entropy while the loss of enthalpy due to breaking hydrogen bonds is compensated by enhanced van der Waals interactions. Tetrahedral hydrogen bonding is of lower enthalpy resulting in tetrahedrally bonded water patches appearing, but only as fluctuations with size and life-time increasing at lower temperatures. Measurements of the structure at deeply supercooled conditions show a continuous increase in tetrahedrality which becomes accelerated below the temperature of homogeneous ice nucleation. The two local structures are connected to the liquid–liquid critical point (LLCP) hypothesis in supercooled water and correspond to high density liquid (HDL) and low density liquid (LDL). We propose that both HDL and LDL behave as normal liquids and that the anomalous properties of water result from the transition between them, which occurs over a wide temperature range at ambient pressure. The key issue is the competition between incompatible conditions for maximizing the entropy, favored in HDL, and minimizing the enthalpy, favored in LDL, which leads to the instability in the liquid and is the fundamental origin of the proposed LLCP."

The method is based on a purely first-principles procedure. The liquid water polarizability tensor is found to be nearly isotropic in the molecular framework. Important environmental effects occur in the two ionic systems when the nature and concentration of the cations are changed. The results of these calculations will be useful in the building of interaction potentials which include polarization effects.}

Here, we follow reactions of octanol, a proxy for environmentally relevant soluble surfactants, initiated by an attack by triplet-state carbonyl compounds, which are themselves concentrated at the interface by the presence of this surfactant. Gas-phase products are determined using PTR-ToF-MS, and those remaining in the organic layer are determined by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and HPLC-HRMS. We observe the photosensitized production of carboxylic acids as well as unsaturated and branched-chain oxygenated products, compounds that act as organic aerosol precursors and had been thought to be produced solely by biological activity. A mechanism that is consistent with the observations is detailed here, and the energetics of several key reactions are calculated using quantum chemical methods. The results suggest that the concentrating nature of the interface leads to its being a favorable venue for radical reactions yielding complex and functionalized products that themselves could initiate further secondary chemistry and new particle formation in the atmospheric environment.",

abstract = "We show that nanocrystals share a common and intrinsic skin electric-double-layer (EDL). The EDL is determined to be 2.14 regular-bond-length thick using differential phonon spectroscopy that distills phonon abundance transiting from the core region to the EDL of the sized crystals. Theoretical reproduction of the size-resolved Raman shift for Si, CeO2, and SnO2 nanocrystals, elasticity of ZnO, and the XPS 2p energy shift, band gap expansion and melting point shift of Si crystals confirmed the universality of the EDL of which bonds are shorter and stronger than those inside the bulk or the particle core interior. The EDL bond contraction and the associated electron entrapment and polarization originate, and the EDL volume quantifies the size dependency of nanostructures while the electron entrapment or polarization entitles the undercoordinated single or edge atoms with properties that a bulk does never show."

By performing isotope substitution on specific atomic sites, it is possible to develop a comprehensive picture of the way water molecules organize themselves around the ions and molecules which dissolve in or mix with water. The resulting data provide a sensitive, sometimes controversial, test of existing theories of the aqueous systems, which due to their complexity at the microscopic level, can normally only be derived using computer simulation techniques. This paper reviews some of the recent achievements in the field of neutron diffraction from aqueous systems and suggests how future experiments might be interpreted with the aid of computer simulation techniques.}

These properties become increasingly complex and controversial as we progress into and below the ‘no man's land' where bulk water can only exist as crystalline ice. Various, so far unconfirmed, scenarios are painted for this region, including the second critical point scenario, the singularity-free scenario, and most recently the ‘critical point-free’ scenario [C.A. Angell, Science 319, 582 (2008)]. In this article the structural aspects of water in its supercooled, amorphous and confined states are explored, to the extent that these are known, and related to the water phase diagram. An important issue to emerge is the extent to which structural measurements on a disordered material can tell us about its phase. }

A broad range of water investigations are addressed, from conventional infrared and Raman spectroscopy to femtosecond pump–probe, photon-echo, optical Kerr effect, sum-frequency generation, and two-dimensional infrared spectroscopic studies. Additionally, we discuss novel approaches, such as two-dimensional sum-frequency generation, three-dimensional infrared, and two-dimensional Raman terahertz spectroscopy. By comparison of the complementary aspects probed by various linear and nonlinear spectroscopic techniques, a coherent picture of water dynamics and energetics emerges. Furthermore, we outline future perspectives of vibrational spectroscopy for water researches.}}

abstract= {{The uniqueness of water originates from its three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network, but this hydrogen-bond network is suddenly truncated at the interface and non-hydrogen-bonded OH (free OH) appears. Although this free OH is the most characteristic feature of interfacial water, the molecular-level understanding of its dynamic property is still limited due to the technical difficulty. We study ultrafast vibrational relaxation dynamics of the free OH at the air/water interface using time-resolved heterodyne-detected vibrational sum frequency generation (TR-HD-VSFG) spectroscopy. With the use of singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis, the vibrational relaxation (T1) times of the free OH at the neat H2O and isotopically-diluted water interfaces are determined to be 0.87 ± 0.06 ps (neat H2O), 0.84 ± 0.09 ps (H2O/HOD/D2O = 1/2/1), and 0.88 ± 0.16 ps (H2O/HOD/D2O = 1/8/16). The absence of the isotope effect on the T1 time indicates that the main mechanism of the vibrational relaxation of the free OH is reorientation of the topmost water molecules. The determined sub-picosecond T1 time also suggests that the free OH reorients diffusively without the switching of the hydrogen-bond partner by the topmost water molecule.}}

abstract= {{Air/aqueous interfaces provide a unique environment for many chemical, environmental, and biological processes. To gain insight, molecular-level understanding of the interfacial water organization and ion distributions at these interfaces is required. Here, the air/aqueous interface of NaClO4 salt solutions was investigated by means of conventional and heterodyne-detected vibrational sum frequency generation (HD-VSFG) spectroscopy. It is found that perchlorate (ClO4–) ions exist in the interfacial region and prefer to reside on average above their counterions. This finding is inferred from the average orientation of the OH transition dipole moment of interfacial water molecules governed by the direction of the net electric field arising from the interfacial ion distributions. At the air/aqueous interface of NaClO4 salt solutions, the net dipole moments of hydrogen-bonded water molecules are oriented preferentially toward the vapor phase. Contrary to some other salts (e.g., sulfates), the presence of ClO4– may cause a full reversal in the direction of the interfacial electric field at a higher concentration (≥1.7 M). Another interpretation for the positive Im χ(2) spectra of NaClO4 salt solutions could be an increase in the population of water species contributing positively to the net OH transition dipole moment. Regardless of the mechanism, this effect becomes even more pronounced with increasing salt concentration.}}

By analyzing the nonlinear vSFG (vibrational sum frequency generation) spectrum of the LV interface in terms of layer-by-layer signal, we demonstrate that the 2D water sheet is solely responsible for the spectral signatures, hence providing the interfacial 3.5 Å thickness effectively probed in nonlinear interfacial spectroscopy.

@article{Tsuruta10,
abstract = {The excellent biocompatibility of PMEA was ascribed by Tanaka to the predominant population of intermediate water in the hydrated polymer matrix. The intermediate water concept was examined using the 'nano-plate model' on the basis of new results (by Morita) of a time-resolved IR study on the water sorption process into PMEA. The examination showed that the image picture proposed by Tanaka concerning the role of intermediate water was in consistent with experimental results so far obtained. Morita showed that the intermediate water exhibited a strong peak at 3400 cm-1 in its IR spectrum. Water sorption profiles of MMA, PEG and PMVE were found to be similar to that of PMEA. It was shown that the biocompatibility of these polymers could be explained by the intermediate water concept. It was also pointed out that PVP and PDMAA have a considerable amount of intermediate water under appropriate circumstances. The PHEMA-water system showed neither clear peak for cold crystallization in DSC chart, nor the strong peak at 3400 cm-1 in its IR spectrum, because the PHEMA system did not contain enough intermediate water to show similar behavior to PMEA. The hydrated PHEMA matrix contains a stable network structure of water molecules including the nodes of OH groups of its side-chains. In the stable network system, most water molecules should be hydrogen bonded strongly to form non-freezing water, but not intermediate water. The inferior biocompatibility of PHEMA was ascribed to the stable network structure of water molecules. Some of the PHEMA co-polymers, on the other hand, were found to have highly improved biocompatibility. Mechanism for the improvement was discussed in terms of loosening the network structure, which could be brought about by introducing ionic groups or branching to the polymer chains through co-polymerization with appropriate 'key monomers'. The mobility of polymer chains, as well as the population of three kinds of water in polysaccharide molecules in aqueous medium could change in response to their chemical structure such as nature of ionic groups, the degree of branching, etc. Polysaccharides located at the utmost-outer layer of blood cells probably possess a loosened network structure to form soft biological surface where intermediate water predominates. Cellulose, on the other hand, has a common feature with PHEMA in the sense of predominance of the non-freezing water in its hydrated system. Note: The word 'biocompatibility' is used in general as the term evaluating properties of materials which do not cause adverse effect when the materials come into contact with living organisms, such as proteins, biological cells and tissues. This review paper primarily deals with 'biocompatibility' of polymer materials against various biological elements in blood flow system. {\textcopyright} 2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

be bimodal in nature. The self-diffusion constant of water is calculated to be larger at the surface than in the
bulk.}}

abstract= {{Vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy (VSFS) has been used to study the structure of water in contact to fused silica surfaces, hydrophobically modified with a series of alkyl trichlorosilane monolayers of varying degrees of order. The interfacial molecular structural information was complemented using total internal reflection (TIR) Raman spectroscopy. The silane molecules consisted of octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) and its shorter chain analogue with eight carbon atoms. The VSF spectra show a direct correlation between monolayer order and the intensity of the free OH mode, characteristic of straddling water molecules vibrating in direct contact to the hydrophobic layer, with a concurrent reduction of the bands associated with hydrogen bonded water molecules. The results imply that the structure of water in the most ordered monolayers is not much affected beyond the first layer of water molecules, with bulk isotropic properties becoming apparent already at subnanometer distances from the surface. Contact angle measurements with both water and hexadecane were also performed in an effort to relate macroscopically measurable parameters to the molecular surface structure provided by VSFS and TIR Raman. Only the receding contact angles, and in particular those with hexadecane, were found to correlate with the monolayer order. Finally, to obtain an additional insight into the water structure in direct contact to an ordered hydrophobic surface, isotopic dilution experiments with D2O were also performed. They indicate that the vibrational coupling mechanism of water molecules at the hydrophobized solid/water interface is different from what has been observed at the liquid/vapor interface.}}

abstract = {X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements provide us with atomically resolved structures of an ever-growing number of biomolecules. These static structural snapshots are important to our understanding of biomolecular function, but real biomolecules are dynamic entities that often exploit conformational changes and transient molecular interactions to perform their tasks. Nuclear magnetic resonance methods can follow such structural changes, but only on millisecond timescales under non-equilibrium conditions. Time-resolved X-ray crystallography has recently been used to monitor the photodissociation of CO from myoglobin on a subnanosecond timescale, yet remains challenging to apply more widely. In contrast, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, which maps vibrational coupling between molecular groups and hence their relative positions and orientations, is now routinely used to study equilibrium processes on picosecond timescales. Here we show that the extension of this method into the non-equilibrium regime allows us to observe in real time in a short peptide the weakening of an intramolecular hydrogen bond and concomitant opening of a $\beta$-turn. We find that the rate of this process is two orders of magnitude faster than the 'folding speed limit' established for contact formation between protein side chains. {\textcopyright}2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract  ="X-Ray photoemission spectroscopy operating under ambient pressure conditions is used to probe ion distributions throughout the interfacial region of a free-flowing aqueous liquid micro-jet of 6 M potassium fluoride. Varying the energy of the ejected photoelectrons by carrying out experiments as a function of X-ray wavelength measures the composition of the aqueous–vapor interfacial region at various depths. The F− to K+ atomic ratio is equal to unity throughout the interfacial region to a depth of 2 nm. The experimental ion profiles are compared with the results of a classical molecular dynamics simulation of a 6 M aqueous KF solution employing polarizable potentials. The experimental results are in qualitative agreement with the simulations when integrated over an exponentially decaying probe depth characteristic of an APPES experiment. First principles molecular dynamics simulations have been used to calculate the potential of mean force for moving a fluoride anion across the air–water interface. The results show that the fluoride anion is repelled from the interface{,} consistent with the depletion of F− at the interface revealed by the APPES experiment and polarizable force field-based molecular dynamics simulation. Together{,} the APPES and MD simulation data provide a detailed description of the aqueous–vapor interface of alkali fluoride systems. This work offers the first direct observation of the ion distribution at an aqueous potassium fluoride solution interface. The current experimental results are compared to those previously obtained for saturated solutions of KBr and KI to underscore the strong difference in surface propensity between soft/large and hard/small halide ions in aqueous solution."}

In both cases, the surface composition of the saturated solution is enhanced in the halide anion compared with the bulk of the solution. The enhancement of anion concentration is more dramatic for the larger, more polarizable iodide anion. By varying photoelectron kinetic energies, we have obtained depth profiles of the liquid/vapor interface. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with classical molecular dynamics simulations.
